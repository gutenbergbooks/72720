<h2>LOVE OF GOD</h2>
</div>

<p>Jesus!... I would so love Him!
Love Him as never yet He has been
loved....</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">IV LETTER TO MÈRE AGNÈS DE JÉSUS</span><br>

</p>


<p>The science of love! Sweet is the
echo of that word to the ear of my soul.
I desire no other science. <i>Having given all
my substance for it</i>, like the spouse in the
Canticles, <i>I think that I have given
nothing</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">HISTOIRE D’UNE AME, CH. VIII</span><br>

<p>Without love, deeds, even the most
brilliant, count as nothing.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">HIST. D’UNE AME, CH. VIII</span><br>
</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>One evening, at a loss for words to
tell Jesus how I loved Him and how
much I wished that He might be everywhere
served and glorified, I reflected
with pain that not one act of love would
ever mount upwards from out of the
depths of hell. Then I cried out that
willingly would I consent to see myself
plunged into that place of torment and
blasphemy, in order that He might be
loved there eternally. That could not
really glorify Him since He desires only
our happiness, but love makes one want
to say a thousand foolish things. If I
spoke thus, it was not that I did not
long for heaven; but then, my heaven
was none other than <i>Love</i>, and in my
fervour I felt that nothing could separate
me from the Divine object of my love....</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">HIST. D’UNE AME, CH. V</span><br>
</p>


<p>Seeing the eternal recompense so
disproportionate to the trifling sacrifices
of this life, I longed to love Jesus, to love
Him ardently, to give Him a thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
proofs of tenderness while yet I could
do so....</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">HIST. D’UNE AME, CH. V</span><br>
</p>


<p>The love of God reveals itself in the
very simplest soul who resists His grace
in nothing, as well as in the most sublime.
Indeed, the characteristic of love
being to humble itself, if all souls
resembled those of the holy Doctors
who have enlightened the Church, the
good God would not seem to descend
low enough in coming to them. But He
has created the infant who knows nothing
and can only wail; He has created the
poor savage who has but the natural
law for guidance, and it is even unto their
hearts that He deigns to stoop.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">HIST. D’UNE AME, CH. I</span><br>
</p>


<p>In order that Love may be fully satisfied
it must needs stoop to very nothingness
and transform that nothing into fire.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">HIST. D’UNE AME, CH. XI</span><br>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>


<p>In times of aridity when I am incapable
of praying, of practising virtue, I seek
little opportunities, mere trifles, to give
pleasure to Jesus; for instance a smile, a
pleasant word when inclined to be silent
and to show weariness. If I find no
opportunities, I at least tell Him again
and again that I love Him; that is not
difficult and it keeps alive the fire in
my heart. Even though this fire of love
might seem to me extinct I would still
throw little straws upon the embers and
I am certain it would rekindle.</p>

<p>On <i>the day of my conversion</i> Charity
entered into my heart and with it a
yearning to forget self always; thenceforward
I was happy.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">HIST. D’UNE AME, CH. V</span><br>
</p>


<p>I do not will that creatures should
possess a single atom of my love; I wish
to give all to Jesus, since He makes me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
understand that He alone is perfect
happiness. All shall be for Him, all!
And even when I have nothing to offer
Him I will give Him that nothing.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">II LETTER TO MÈRE AGNÈS DE JÉSUS</span><br>
</p>


<p>Our Lord is more tender than a
mother, and well do I know more than
one maternal heart! I know a mother
is ever ready to forgive the little involuntary
failings of her child.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">HIST. D’UNE AME, CH. VIII</span><br>
</p>


<p>I know of one means only by which
to attain to perfection: <span class="smcap">Love</span>. Let us
love, since our heart is made for nothing
else. Sometimes I seek another word
to express Love, but in this land of
exile <i>the word which begins and ends</i><a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> is
quite incapable of rendering the vibrations
of the soul; we must then adhere
to this simple and only word: <span class="smcap">To Love</span>.</p>

<p>But on whom shall our poor heart
lavish its love? Who shall be found that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
is great enough to be the recipient of its
treasures? Will a human being know
how to comprehend them, and above
all will he be able to repay? There
exists but one Being capable of comprehending
love; it is Jesus; He alone can
give us back infinitely more than we
shall ever give to Him.</p>

<p>There is one <span class="allsmcap">ONLY THING</span> to do here

nothing—He does so want our love!</p>

<p>I have no longer any desire unless it
be to love Jesus even to folly! Yes, <span class="smcap">Love</span>
it is that draws me. I can say these
words of the canticle of our Father, St.
John of the Cross:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</p>


<p>Oh! if souls weak and imperfect as
mine, felt what I feel, not one would
despair of reaching the summit of the
mountain of Love, since Jesus does not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
demand from us great deeds, but only
self-surrender and gratitude.</p>

<p><i>I have no need</i>, saith He, <i>of the goats of
thy flocks.... If I were hungry I would
not tell thee.... Offer unto God the sacrifice
of praise and thanksgiving.</i><a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>See then, all that Jesus asks of us!
He has not need of our works but only
of our <i>love</i>. This very God who declares
that He needs not to tell us if He were
hungry, did not hesitate to <i>beg</i> of the
Samaritan woman a little water.... He
thirsted!!! But in saying: “<i>Give me to
drink</i>,”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> it was the love of His poor
creature that the Creator of the universe
besought. He thirsted for Love!</p>

<p>And now, more than ever is Jesus
athirst. He meets with none but the
ungrateful and the indifferent among the
disciples of the world; and amongst <i>His
own</i> disciples He finds, alas! very few
hearts that surrender themselves without
any reserve to the tenderness of His
infinite Love.</p>

<p>How sweet is the way of Love!
True, one may fall, one may not be
always faithful, but Love, knowing how
to draw profit from all, very quickly
consumes whatsoever may displease Jesus,
leaving naught but humble and profound
peace in the innermost soul.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">HIST. D’UNE AME, CH. VIII</span><br>
</p>


<p>Thinking one day of those who
offer themselves as victims to the Justice
of God in order to turn aside the punishment
reserved for sinners by taking it
upon themselves, I felt this offering to be
noble and generous, but I was far from
feeling moved to make it.</p>

<p>“O my Divine Master,” I cried in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>the depths of my heart, “shall Thy
Justice alone receive victims of holocaust?
Has not Thy Merciful Love also need of
them? On all sides it is ignored, rejected
... the hearts on which Thou wouldst
lavish it turn to creatures, seeking happiness
in miserable and fleeting affections
instead of casting themselves into Thine
arms, into the ineffable furnace of Thine
Infinite Love.</p>

<p>“O my God, must Thy Love—disdained—remain
within Thy Heart?
Methinks that if Thou shouldst find
souls offering themselves as victims of
holocaust to Thy Love, Thou wouldst
consume them rapidly; that Thou wouldst
be glad not to restrict the flames of
infinite tenderness pent up within
Thee.</p>

<p>“If Thy Justice—the Justice which
Thou dost exercise on earth—be pleased
to find voluntary victims on which to
discharge its weight, how much the more
must Thy Merciful Love also desire <i>its</i>
victims, since <i>Thy Mercy reacheth even
to heaven</i>.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>
<p>“O Jesus, that happily I may be that
holocaust consume Thy little victim in
the fire of Divine Love.”</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">HIST. D’UNE AME, CH. VIII</span><br>
</p>


<p>Ah! since that day love penetrates me
and surrounds me; this <i>Merciful Love</i>
each moment renews and purifies me,
leaving in my heart no trace of sin. No,
I cannot fear Purgatory; I know that I
do not merit even to enter with the Holy
Souls into that place of expiation, but
I know too that the fire of Love is more
sanctifying than the fire of Purgatory, I
know that Jesus cannot will needless
suffering for us, and that He would not
inspire me with the desires I feel if He
were unwilling to fulfil them.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">HIST. D’UNE AME, CH. VIII</span><br>
</p>


<p>To offer oneself as a Victim to Divine
Love is not to offer oneself to sweetness—to
consolation; but to every anguish,
every bitterness, for Love lives only by
sacrifice; and the more a soul wills to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
surrendered to Love, the more must she
be surrendered to suffering.</p>

<p>In order to love Jesus, to be His victim
of love, the more weak and miserable we
are, the more fitting are we for the
operations of this consuming and transforming
Love.... The sole desire to be
victim suffices; but we must consent to
remain always poor and without strength,
and there lies the difficulty, for <i>where shall
be found the truly poor in spirit</i>? <i>He
must be sought afar off</i>,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> saith the author
of the <i>Imitation</i>.... He did not say
that we must seek him amongst great
souls, but afar off, that is to say in lowliness,
in nothingness.... Oh! let us keep
<i>afar off</i> from all that glitters, let us love
our littleness, and be satisfied to feel
nothing, then shall we be truly poor in
spirit, and Jesus will come to seek us
how far soever we may be; He will
transform us into flames of Love!...</p>

<p>O my God, Thou knowest I have
never desired but to love Thee alone.
I seek no other glory. Thy Love has
gone before me from my childhood, it
has grown with my growth, and now it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>

<p>Charity gave me the key to my vocation.
I understood that the Church
being a body composed of different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
members, the most essential, the most
noble of all the organs would not be
wanting to her; I understood that the
Church has <i>a heart</i> and that this heart
is burning with love; that it is love alone
which makes the members work, that if
love were to die away apostles would no
longer preach the Gospel, martyrs would
refuse to shed their blood. I understood
that love comprises all vocations, that
love is everything, that it embraces all
times and all places because it is eternal!</p>

<p>O my Well-Beloved! I understand

shall fight.... I am prisoner of Thy
Love; freely have I riveted the chain

the Divine Throne with their fragrance, will
sing with silvery voice the canticle of love.</p>

<p>Yes, my Beloved, it is thus that my
life’s brief day shall be spent before
Thee. No other means have I of proving
my love than to strew flowers; that is,
to let no little sacrifice escape me, not a
look, not a word, to avail of the very
least actions and do them for Love.
I wish to suffer for Love’s sake and for
Love’s sake even to rejoice; thus shall
I strew flowers. Not one shall I find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
without shedding its petals for Thee ...
and then I will sing, I will always sing,
even if I must gather my roses in the

<p>Sœur Thérèse de l’Enfant Jésus
often spoke of a well-known toy with
which in childhood’s days she had amused
herself: a kaleidoscope; in form somewhat
like a small telescope; on looking
through, one sees an endless succession
of pretty and many-coloured designs,
varying at each turn of the kaleidoscope.</p>

<p>“This toy,” she said, “aroused my
admiration and I used to wonder what
could produce so pleasing a phenomenon;
when one day, after serious examination,
I saw there were simply a few tiny scraps
of paper and of wool cut no matter how,
and thrown here and there. I pursued
my investigation and discovered three
mirrors inside the tube: I had there the
key to the problem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>“This was for me the image of a great
mystery. As long as our actions, even
the least of them, remain within the focus
of Love, the Blessed Trinity, which is
figured by the three mirrors, reflects
them, and endows them with a wondrous
beauty. Jesus, looking at us through the
little lens, that is to say, as it were through
Himself, finds all our actions pleasing to
Him. But if we leave the ineffable
centre of Love, what will He see? Mere
straws ... actions sullied and nothing
worth.”</p>

<p>This little prayer which includes all

sweet Jesus, of the Blessed Virgin and
of the Saints, I pray Thee that my sister
be fired with Thy spirit of love, and that
Thou wilt grant her the grace to make
Thee greatly loved.”</p>

<p>If God should take me soon to Himself,
I ask you to continue each day this same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
prayer, for in Heaven my desire will be
the same as upon earth; to love Jesus
and to make Him loved.</p>

said to the Mother Prioress:</p>

<p>“Mother, our Sisters little know what

thinking only of the beauty of the material

</p>


<p>O my God, Most Blessed Trinity, I
desire to love Thee and to make Thee
loved, to labour for the glory of Holy
Church by saving souls still on earth and
by delivering those who suffer in purgatory.
I desire to accomplish Thy Will
perfectly, and to attain to the degree of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
glory which Thou hast prepared for me
in Thy Kingdom, in one word, I desire
to be a saint, but I know that I am
powerless, and I implore Thee, O my
God, to be Thyself my sanctity.</p>

<p>Since Thou hast so loved me as to
give me Thine only Son to be my Saviour
and my Spouse, the infinite treasures of
His merits are mine, to Thee I offer
them with joy, beseeching Thee to see
me only as in the Face of Jesus and in
His Heart burning with Love.</p>

<p>Again, I offer Thee all the merits of
the Saints—in Heaven and on earth—their
acts of love and those of the holy
Angels; and finally I offer Thee, O
Blessed Trinity, the love and the merits
of the Holy Virgin, my most dear Mother;
it is to her I entrust my oblation, begging
her to present it to Thee.</p>

<p>Her Divine Son, my well-beloved
Spouse, during His life on earth, told us:
“<i>If you ask the Father anything in My
Name He will give it to you.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> I am then
certain that Thou wilt hearken to my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
desires.... My God, I know it, the
more Thou willest to give the more dost
Thou make us desire. Immense are
the desires that I feel within my heart,
and it is with confidence that I call upon
Thee to come and take possession of my
soul. I cannot receive Thee in Holy
Communion as often as I would; but,
Lord, art Thou not Almighty?...
Remain in me as in the Tabernacle—never
leave Thy little Victim.</p>

<p>I long to console Thee for the ingratitude
of the wicked and I pray Thee take
from me the liberty to displease Thee!
If through frailty I fall sometimes, may
Thy Divine glance purify my soul
immediately, consuming every imperfection—like
to fire which transforms
all things into itself.</p>

<p>I thank Thee, O my God, for all the
graces Thou hast bestowed on me, and
particularly for making me pass through
the crucible of suffering. It is with joy
I shall behold Thee on the Last Day
bearing Thy sceptre—the Cross; since
Thou hast deigned to give me for my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
portion this most precious Cross, I have
hope of resembling Thee in Heaven and
seeing the sacred stigmata of Thy Passion
shine in my glorified body.</p>

<p>After exile on earth I hope to enjoy
the possession of Thee in our eternal
Fatherland, but I have no wish to amass
merits for Heaven, I will work for Thy
Love alone, my sole aim being to give
Thee pleasure, to console Thy Sacred
Heart, and to save souls who will love
Thee for ever.</p>

<p>At the close of life’s evening I shall
appear before Thee with empty hands,
for I ask not, Lord, that Thou wouldst
count my works.... All our justice is
tarnished in Thy sight. It is therefore
my desire to be clothed with Thine own
Justice and to receive from Thy Love the
eternal possession of Thyself. I crave
no other Throne nor other Crown but
Thee, O my Beloved!...</p>

<p>In Thy sight time is nothing, <i>one day
is as a thousand years</i>.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Thou canst in an
instant prepare me to appear before Thee.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>
<p>That I may live in one Act of perfect
Love, <span class="smcap">I offer myself as a Victim of
Holocaust to Thy Merciful Love</span>,
imploring Thee to consume me without
ceasing, and to let the tide of infinite
tenderness pent up in Thee, overflow
into my soul, that so I may become a
very martyr of Thy Love, O my God!</p>

<p>May this martyrdom, having first
prepared me to appear before Thee, break
life’s thread at last, and may my soul
take its flight, <i>unretarded</i>, into the
eternal embrace of Thy Merciful Love.</p>

<p>I desire, O Well-Beloved, at every
heart-beat to renew this Oblation an
infinite number of times, <i>till the shadows
retire</i><a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and I can tell Thee my love
eternally face to face!</p>

<h2>LOVE OF OUR
NEIGHBOUR</h2>


<p>There are moments when we are so
wretched within, that we must needs
hurry away from ourselves. The good
God does not oblige us to remain at such
times in our own company; indeed He
often permits that it should be displeasing
to us just that we may leave it. And I
see no other means of going out of ourselves
than by going to visit Jesus and
Mary, that is, hastening to deeds of
charity.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">COUNSELS AND REMINISCENCES</span><br>
</p>


<p>I applied myself above all to practise
quite hidden little acts of virtue; thus
I liked to fold the mantles forgotten
by the Sisters, and sought a thousand
opportunities of rendering them service.</p>

<p class="author">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>


<p>Had I been rich I never could have
borne to see a poor person hungry without
giving him to eat. It is the same in
my spiritual life: knowing there are
souls on the point of falling into Hell, I
give them my treasures according as I
earn anything, and I have never yet
found a moment to say: “Now I am
going to work for myself.”</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">COUNSELS AND REMINISCENCES</span><br>
</p>


<p>I feel that when I am charitable it is
Jesus alone who acts in me; the more
I am united to Him the more do I love
all my Sisters. If, when I desire to
increase this love in my heart, the demon
tries to set before my eyes the faults of
one or other of the Sisters, I hasten to call
to mind her virtues, her good desires;
I say to myself that if I have seen her
fall once, she may well have gained
many victories which she conceals through
humility; and that even what appears
to me a fault may in truth be an act of
virtue by reason of the intention.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">HIST. D’UNE AME, CH. IX</span><br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>


<p>True Charity consists in bearing with
all the defects of our neighbour, in not
being surprised at his failings, and in
being edified by his least virtues; Charity
must not remain shut up in the depths
of the heart, for <i>no man lighteth a candle
and putteth it under a bushel, but upon a
candlestick, that it may shine to all that
are in the house</i>.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> It seems to me that
this candle represents the Charity which
ought to enlighten and make joyful, not
only those who are dearest to me, but <i>all
who are in the house</i>.</p>

<p>There is no artist who does not like
his work praised, and the Divine Artist
of souls is pleased when we do not stop
at the exterior, but penetrating even
to the inmost sanctuary which He has
chosen for His dwelling, we admire its
beauty.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">HIST. D’UNE AME, CH. IX</span><br>
</p>

<p>I ought to seek the company of
those Sisters who according to nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
please me least. I ought to fulfil in
their regard the office of the Good
Samaritan. A word, a kindly smile, will
often suffice to gladden a wounded and
sorrowful heart.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">HIST. D’UNE AME, CH. X</span><br>
</p>


<p>Oh! what peace inundates the soul
when she rises above natural sentiment.
No joy can compare with that known to
one who is truly poor in spirit. If he
ask with detachment for some necessary
thing, and it is not only refused him, but
an attempt made besides to deprive him
of what he already has, he follows the
counsel of our Lord: “<i>And if a man will
contend with thee in judgment and take
away thy coat, let go thy cloak also unto
him.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>To yield up our cloak means, I think,
to renounce our last rights, to consider
oneself as the servant, the slave of
others. When we have abandoned our
mantle it is easier to walk, to run; therefore
Jesus adds: “<i>And whosoever will
force thee one mile, go with him other two.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>It is not enough that I should give to
whosoever may ask of me, I must forestall
their desires, and show that I feel
much gratified, much honoured in rendering
service; and if they take a thing
that I use, I must seem as though glad
to be <i>relieved</i> of it.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">HIST. D’UNE AME, CH. IX</span><br>
</p>


<p>If it is hard to give to whoever asks, it
is still harder to let what belongs to us
be taken, without asking it back, or
rather, I ought to say it <i>seems</i> hard; for
<i>the yoke of the Lord is sweet and light</i>:<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
when we accept it we feel its sweetness
immediately.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">HIST. D’UNE AME, CH. IX</span><br>
</p>


<p>When Charity is deeply rooted in the
soul it shows itself exteriorly: there is so
gracious a way of refusing what we
cannot give, that the refusal pleases as
much as the gift.</p>

<span class="allsmcap">HIST. D’UNE AME, CH. IX</span><br>

<p>To want to persuade our Sisters that
they are in the wrong, even when it is
perfectly true, is hardly fair, as we are
not responsible for their guidance. We
must not be <i>Justices of the peace</i>, but only
<i>angels of peace</i>.</p>

<p>Jesus wills that we give alms to Him
as to one poor and needy. He puts
Himself as it were at our mercy; He will
take nothing but what we give Him from
our heart, and the very least trifle is
precious in His sight. He stretches
forth His Hand, this sweet Saviour, to
receive of us a little love, so that in the
radiant day of Judgment He may be
able to address to us those ineffable
words: “<i>Come, ye blessed of My Father;
for I was hungry, and you gave Me to eat;
I was thirsty, and you gave Me to drink;
I was a stranger, and you took Me in;
sick and you visited Me; I was in prison,

<p>If I were still to live, the office of

ought purposely to pass along beneath
the windows of the sick to give them
facility in calling you and asking your
services. Ought you not to consider
yourself like a little slave whom everyone
has a right to command? If you
could but see the Angels who from the
heights of Heaven watch you battling
in the arena! They await the end of
the combat to cover you with flowers and
wreaths. The good God does not disdain
these combats, unknown and therefore
all the more meritorious. “<i>The patient

<p>By our little acts of charity practised
in the shade we convert souls far away,
we help missionaries, we win for them
abundant alms; and by that means build
actual dwellings spiritual and material
for our Eucharistic Lord.</p>

<p>A novice remarked to Sœur Thérèse:
“I do not like to see others suffer, especially
saintly souls.” She replied instantly:</p>

<p>“Oh! I am not like you: to see saints
suffer never moves me to pity! I know
they have the strength to endure, and
they thus give great glory to God: but
those who are not holy, who know not
how to profit by their sufferings, oh! how
I pity them; they do indeed arouse my
compassion, and I would do all I could
to comfort and help them.”</p>

<p>Seeing her extreme weakness the
doctor ordered some strengthening
remedies; Sœur Thérèse was distressed
at first on account of their high price:
then she said to us: “I am no longer
grieved about taking these costly
remedies, for I have been reading that
St. Gertrude rejoiced at the thought
that all would be to the advantage of
those who do us good, since our Lord
has said: ‘<i>As long as you did it unto one
of these My least brethren you did it unto
Me.</i>’”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>She added: “I am convinced of the
uselessness of medicine for the purpose
of curing me, but I have made a compact
with the good God, that He is to allow
some poor Missionaries to profit by it,
who have neither time nor means to take
care of themselves.”</p>

<p>Remembering that <i>Charity covereth
a multitude of sins</i>,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> I draw from this
fruitful mine opened to us by our Lord in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>His sacred Gospels. I search the depths
of His adorable words and cry out with
David: “<i>I have run in the way of Thy
commandments when Thou didst enlarge
my heart.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> And charity alone can
enlarge my heart....</p>

<p>O Jesus! since this sweet flame consumes
it I run with delight in the way of
Thy new Commandment, and therein
will I run until the blessed day when
with Thy Virgin train I shall follow
Thee through Thy boundless Realm
singing Thy <i>New Canticle</i> which must
surely be <i>the Canticle of <span class="smcap">Love</span></i>.</p>

<h2>FAITH</h2>


<p>What helps me most when I picture
to myself the interior of the Holy
Family is to think of a quite ordinary
life.</p>

<p>The Blessed Virgin and St. Joseph
knew well that Jesus was God, but
wondrous things were nevertheless hidden
from them and like us they lived by
faith. Have you not noticed what is
said in the sacred text: “<i>And they understood
not the word that He spoke unto
them</i>,”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and these other words no less
mysterious: “<i>His father and mother were
wondering at those things which were
spoken concerning Him?</i>”<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Does not
this imply that they heard of something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
new to them, for this wondering suggests
a certain astonishment?</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">COUNSELS AND REMINISCENCES</span><br>
</p>


<p>During her temptations against faith
she wrote: “I strive to work by faith
though bereft of its consolations. I
have made more acts of Faith in this
last year than during all the rest of my
life.</p>

<p>“On each fresh occasion of combat,
when the enemy desires to challenge me,
I conduct myself valiantly: knowing
that to fight a duel is an unworthy act,
I turn my back upon the adversary without
ever looking him in the face; then
I run to my Jesus and tell Him I am ready
to shed every drop of blood in testimony
of my belief that there is a Heaven, I
tell Him I am glad to be unable to contemplate,
while on earth, with the eyes
of the soul, the beautiful Heaven that
awaits me so He will deign to open it for
eternity to poor unbelievers.”</p>

<p>He whose Heart ever watcheth, taught
me, that while for a soul whose faith
equals but a tiny grain of mustard seed,
he works miracles, in order that this
faith which is so weak may be fortified;
yet for His intimate friends, for His
Mother, He did not work miracles until
He had put their faith to the test. Did
He not let Lazarus die though Martha
and Mary had sent to tell Him that he
was sick? At the marriage at Cana,
the Blessed Virgin having asked Him to
come to the assistance of the Master of
the house, did He not reply that His
hour was not yet come? But after the
trial, what a recompense! Water changed
to wine, Lazarus restored to life....</p>

<p>A sister said to her that beautiful
Angels clothed in white robes, and of

would bear away her soul to Heaven.
She replied: “These imaginations do

except from the Truth. God and the
Angels are pure Spirits, no one can see
them as they really are, with corporal
eyes. That is why I have never desired
extraordinary favours. I would rather
await the Eternal Vision.”</p>

<p>“I have asked God to send me a beautiful

<h2>HOPE</h2>

already God sees us in glory and takes

<p>A day ... an hour ... and we shall

shall we see then? What is that life
which will never have an end?... Jesus
will be the soul of our soul. Unfathomable
mystery! “<i>Eye hath not seen, nor

<p>Life is passing, Eternity draws nigh;

an end and with our Heavenly Spouse
we shall sail o’er boundless waters: now
our <i>harps are hung upon the willows that
border the rivers of Babylon</i>,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> but in the
day of our deliverance what harmonies
will then be heard! With what joy shall
we not make every chord of our instruments
to vibrate! Today, <i>we weep remembering

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">V LETTER TO SR. MARIE DU SACRÉ-CŒUR</span><br>
</p>


<p>Oh! What mysteries will be revealed
to us later.... How often have I thought
that I perhaps owe all the graces showered
upon me to the earnest prayer of a little
soul whom I shall know only in Heaven.
It is God’s will that in this world by
means of prayer Heavenly treasures
should be imparted by souls one to
another, so that when they reach the
Fatherland they may love one another
with a love born of gratitude, with an
affection far, far exceeding the most ideal
family affection upon earth.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>
<p>There, we shall meet with no indifferent
looks, because all the Saints will be
indebted to each other.</p>

<p>No envious glances will be seen; the
happiness of every one of the elect will
be the happiness of all. With the
Martyrs we shall be like to the Martyrs;
with the Doctors we shall be as the
Doctors; with the Virgins, as the Virgins;
and just as the members of a family are
proud of one another, so shall we be
of our brethren, without the least
jealousy.</p>

<p>Who knows even if the joy we shall
experience in beholding the glory of the
great Saints, and knowing that by a
secret dispensation of Providence we
have contributed thereunto, who knows
if this joy will not be as intense and
sweeter perhaps, than the happiness they
will themselves possess.</p>

<p>And do you not think that on their
side the great Saints, seeing what they
owe to quite little souls, will love them
with an incomparable love? Delightful
and surprising will be the friendships<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
found there—I am sure of it. The
favoured companion of an Apostle or a
great Doctor of the Church, will perhaps
be a young shepherd lad; and a simple
little child may be the intimate friend of
a Patriarch. Oh! how I long to dwell
in that Kingdom of Love....</p>

<p>Since Jesus has gone back to Heaven
I can follow Him only by the path He
has traced. Oh how luminous are His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
footprints—diffusing a divine sweetness....
I have but to glance at the
holy Gospels and immediately I inhale
the fragrance of the life of Jesus, and I
know which side to take. Not to the
first place do I run but to the last. I
let the Pharisee go up, and full of confidence
I repeat the humble prayer of the
publican. Above all I copy the example
of Magdalene; her amazing, or rather,
her loving audacity, which so touched
the Heart of Jesus, charms my own.</p>

<p class="author">

<p>With a simplicity that delights me
my little Sisters, the novices, tell me of
the interior combats I arouse in them,
in what way they find me trying; they
are no more embarrassed than if it were
question of some one else, knowing that
by acting thus, they greatly please me.</p>

<p>Ah! truly it is more than a pleasure,
it is a delicious feast which replenishes
my soul with joy. How can a thing so
disagreeable to nature give such happiness?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
Had I not experienced it I could
not have believed it.</p>

<p>One day when I had an ardent desire
for humiliation, it happened that a
young postulant so fully satisfied it,
that the thought of Semei cursing David
came to my mind and I repeated interiorly
with the holy King: <i>Yes, it is indeed the
Lord who has commanded him to say all
these things to me</i>.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Thus the good God takes care of me.
He cannot always offer me the strength-giving
bread of exterior humiliation, but
from time to time He permits me to
feast upon <i>the crumbs that fall from the
table of the children</i>.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> How great is His
Mercy!</p>

<p>I am too little to have any vanity, I
am also too little to know how to turn
beautiful phrases so as to make it appear
that I have a great deal of humility.
I prefer to acknowledge simply that
<i>He that is mighty hath done great things
to me</i>;<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and the greatest is His having
shown me my littleness, my powerlessness
for all good.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">HIST. D’UNE AME, CH. IX</span><br>
</p>


<p>The only thing not subject to be
envied is the lowest place, it is therefore
this lowest place alone which is without
vanity and affliction of spirit. Still, <i>the
way of a man is not always in his power</i><a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
and sometimes we are surprised by a
desire for that which glitters. Then, let
us take our place humbly amongst the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
imperfect, deeming ourselves little souls
whom the good God must sustain at
each moment. As soon as He sees us
truly convinced of our nothingness and
we say to Him: <i>My foot hath slipped:
Thy mercy, O Lord, hath held me up</i>,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
He stretches out His Hand to us; but
if we <i>will</i> attempt to do something
grand, even under pretext of zeal, He
leaves us alone. It is enough therefore
that we humble ourselves, and bear our
imperfections with sweetness: there, for
us, lies true sanctity.</p>

velvety surface? Is it for the sake of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
the peach that He has given it so delicious
a flavour? No, it is for us; what alone
belongs to it and forms the essence of its
existence is its stone; it possesses nothing
more.</p>

<p>Thus is Jesus pleased to lavish His gifts
on some of His creatures, that through
them He may draw to Himself other
souls; but in His mercy He humiliates
them interiorly, and gently constrains
them to recognize their nothingness and
His Omnipotence. These sentiments
form in them, as it were, a kernel of
grace, which Jesus hastens to develop
for that blessed day when clothed with
a beauty, immortal, imperishable, they
shall without danger have place at the
Celestial banquet.</p>

<p>The Apostles, without Jesus, laboured
long—a whole night—without taking
any fish; their toil was pleasing to Him
but He wished to show that He alone
can give anything. He asked only an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>act of humility: “<i>Children, have you any
meat?</i>”<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and St. Peter confesses his
helplessness: “<i>Lord we have laboured all
night and have taken nothing.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> It is
enough! The Heart of Jesus is touched....
Perhaps if the Apostle had taken a
few little fishes the Divine Master would
not have worked a miracle; but he had
<i>nothing</i>, and so through God’s power and
goodness his nets were soon filled with
great fishes.</p>

<p>That is just our Lord’s way. He gives
as God, but He <i>will</i> have humility of
heart.</p>

<span class="allsmcap">XVII LETTER TO HER SISTER CÉLINE</span><br>
</p>


<p>To think ourselves imperfect, and
others perfect—that is happiness. That
creatures should recognize we are without
virtue takes nothing from us, makes
us no poorer; it is they who by this lose
interior joy; for there is nothing sweeter
than to think well of our neighbour.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">COUNSELS AND REMINISCENCES</span><br>
</p>


<p>It is a great joy to me, not only when
others find me imperfect, but above all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
when I feel that so I am: compliments,
on the contrary, cause me nothing but
displeasure.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">COUNSELS AND REMINISCENCES</span><br>
</p>


<p>A novice confided to her that she
made no progress and felt quite discouraged.</p>

<p>“Till the age of fourteen,” said Thérèse,
“I practised virtue without feeling its
sweetness. I wished for suffering but
had no thought of finding my joy therein;
that is a grace which has been granted
me later. My soul was like a beautiful
tree whose blossoms no sooner opened
than they fell.</p>

<p>“Offer to the good God the sacrifice
of never gathering the fruits of your
labours. If He so will that during your
whole life you feel a repugnance to
suffer and to be humiliated, if He permit
that all the flowers of your desires and of
your good-will fall to earth without
fruit, be not troubled. At the moment
of your death He will know well how to
bring to perfection, in the twinkling of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
an eye, beautiful fruits on the tree of
your soul.</p>

<p>“We read in the Book of Ecclesiasticus:
‘<i>There is an inactive man that wanteth
help, is very weak in ability, and full of
poverty: yet the eye of God hath looked
upon him for good, and hath lifted him up
from his low estate, and hath exalted his
head: and many have wondered at him and
have glorified God.</i></p>

<p>‘<i>Trust in God, and stay in thy place.
For it is easy in the eyes of God, on a
sudden to make the poor man rich. The
blessing of God maketh haste to reward
the just, and in a swift hour His blessing
beareth fruit!</i>’”<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>“You have always been faithful to
divine grace, have you not?”</p>

<p>“Yes, since the age of three I have
refused nothing to the good God. Yet
not mine the glory. See how the setting
sun this evening gilds the topmost
branches of the trees; even so does my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
soul appear to you—all bright and
gilded, because it is exposed to Love’s
rays. If the Divine Sun withheld from
me His rays, my soul would immediately
become obscured and enveloped in darkness.”</p>

<p>“You really are a saint!” some one said
to her.</p>

<p>“No, I am not a saint; I have never
done the works of the Saints. I am a
very, very little soul on whom the good
God has outpoured the abundance of
His grace. You will see in Heaven that
I am telling you the truth.”</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">COUNSELS AND REMINISCENCES</span><br>
</p>


<p>She said to the Prioress: “Mother, I
feel that if I were unfaithful, if I committed
but the very slightest infidelity,
fearful troubles would follow, and I
could no longer accept death with resignation.”</p>

<p>And as the Mother Prioress showed
surprise at hearing her speak thus, she
continued:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>“I mean an infidelity springing from
pride. For instance, if I said: ‘I have
acquired such or such a virtue, I am able
to practise it,’ or, ‘O my God, I love
Thee too well—Thou knowest it—to
dwell on one single thought against
faith,’ I feel that I should forthwith be
assailed by the most dangerous temptations
and should certainly be overcome
by them.</p>

<p>“To avoid this calamity I have but to
say humbly from the depths of my
heart: ‘O my God, I implore of Thee,
suffer me not to be unfaithful!’</p>

<p>“I very well understand how St.
Peter fell. He depended too confidently
on the fervour of his feelings, instead of
relying solely upon Divine strength.
Had he said to Jesus: ‘Lord, give me
the strength to follow Thee even unto
death,’ that strength, I am quite sure
would not have been refused him.”</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">COUNSELS AND REMINISCENCES</span><br>
</p>


<p>“Oh! when I think of all I have to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>acquire!” exclaimed a novice.</p>

<p>“Say, rather, <i>to lose</i>. Jesus, it is,
who charges Himself with the care of
filling your soul according as you free
it from its imperfections. I plainly see
that you are taking the wrong road,
you will never arrive at the end of your
journey. You wish to scale a mountain
and the good God wants to make you
descend: He is waiting for you low
down in the fertile valley of humility.”</p>

<p>“When I receive a reproof,” said
another, “I would rather have deserved
it than be wrongfully accused.”</p>

<p>“As for me,” replied Thérèse, “I prefer
being blamed unjustly, then I have no
cause for self-reproach and I offer this
unmerited blame to the good God with
joy, then I humble myself at the thought
that I should be quite capable of doing
that of which I was accused.”</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">COUNSELS AND REMINISCENCES</span><br>
</p>


<p>When we are not understood, and
are unfavourably judged, what good is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
there in defending ourselves? Let us
leave it so and say nothing, it is so
sweet to let ourselves be judged no
matter how! It is not told in the Gospels
that Saint Magdalen gave any explanation
when blamed by her sister for
sitting inactive at the feet of Jesus. She
did not say: “Martha, if thou didst but
know my happiness, if thou didst but
hear the words I hear, thou too wouldst
lay all else aside, to share my joy and my
repose.” No, she chose rather to be
silent.... O blessed silence which gives
to the soul such peace!</p>

<p>In a moment of temptation and combat
a novice received this note:</p>

<p>“<i>The just man shall correct me in mercy
and reprove me; but let not the oil of the
sinner anoint my head.</i><a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> I cannot be
corrected or tried except by the just,
inasmuch as all my Sisters are pleasing
to God. It is less bitter to be reproved
by a sinner than by the just; but <i>through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
compassion for sinners</i>, to obtain their
conversion, I pray Thee, O my God,
that I may be bruised by the just souls
who are round about me. Again, I beg
that the oil of praise, so sweet to nature,
<i>anoint not my head</i>, that is to say, enervate
not my mind, by making me believe that
I possess virtues which I have only with
difficulty practised several times.</p>

<p>“O my Jesus! <i>Thy Name is as oil poured
out</i>;<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> it is in this divine perfume that I
wish to be wholly bathed, far away from
the notice of creatures.”</p>

<p class="author">

<p>At the close of her life she was able
to say: “I used so to rise above all
things, that I drew strength from humiliations.”</p>

<p>“God has a special love for you,”
remarked a young Sister, “since to you
He entrusts other souls.”</p>

<p>“That does not add anything to me,
and I am only really just what I am in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
God’s sight.... It does not follow that
He loves me more, because He wills that
I should be His interpreter to you;
rather, He makes me your little servant.
It is for you and not for me that He has
given me the charms and virtues apparent
to you.</p>

<p>“Often I compare myself to a little
bowl which God fills with good things of
every kind. All <i>the kittens</i> come to it to
take their share, and sometimes there is
a contest as to which shall have most.
But the Child Jesus is there, keeping
watch: ‘I am very willing that you
drink from my little bowl’ saith He,
‘but take care lest you overturn it and
break it.’</p>

<p>“Truth to tell, the danger is not great,
because I am placed on the ground.
It is otherwise with Prioresses: they,
being set on tables run many more risks.
Honours are always dangerous.</p>

<p>“Oh! how poisonous the praises served
up day by day to those who hold high
places. What baneful incense! And
how necessary it is that the soul be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
detached from self, that so she may
escape unharmed.”</p>

<p>To help a novice to accept a humiliation
she said to her in confidence:
“If I had not been received into Carmel
I would have entered a Refuge, to live
there unknown and despised in the
midst of the poor penitents. To pass
for such in the eyes of all would have
been my happiness. I should have been
the apostle of my companions telling
them what I think of the Mercy of the
good God.”</p>

<p>“But how would you have been able
to hide your innocence from your Confessor?”</p>

<p>“I would have told him that while in
the world I had made a general confession
and had been forbidden to do so again.”</p>

<p>One day they brought her some ears
of corn. She took one so laden with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
grain that it leaned down upon its stalk,
and having looked at it for a long time
she said to the Mother Prioress:</p>

<p>“Mother, this ear of corn is an image
of my soul: the good God has laden me
with graces for myself and for many
others!... Oh! I wish ever to bow
down beneath the abundance of Heaven’s
gifts, recognizing that all comes from

repay me.... I would not give Him the
trouble.</p>

<p>Far from dazzling me all the titles of

I have understood those words of the
<i>Imitation</i>: “<i>Be not solicitous for the
shadow of a great name</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> I have understood
that true greatness is found not in
the name but in the soul.</p>

<p>The Prophet tells us that <i>the Lord God
shall call His servants by</i> <span class="allsmcap">ANOTHER NAME</span>;<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
and we read in St. John: “<i>To him that
overcometh, I will give ... a white counter,
and in the counter a new name written, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>no man knoweth but he that receiveth.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
It is in Heaven, therefore, that we shall
know our titles of nobility. Then <i>shall
each one receive from God the praise that
he merits</i>,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> and he who upon earth will
have made choice of being the poorest
and the most unknown for love of our
Lord, he will be the first, the noblest and

<p>“One Sunday,” Thérèse tells us, “I
went right joyously on my way towards
the alley of chestnut trees; it was the
spring-time, and I meant to enjoy the
beauties of nature. O cruel disappointment!
My dear chestnut trees had
been pruned, and the branches, already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
loaded with verdant buds, lay strewn
upon the ground! It was heartrending
to view this destruction, and to think that
three years must pass ere I could see it
repaired.... My distress however did
not last. ‘If I were in another monastery,’
thought I, ‘what difference would
it make to me if the chestnut trees in
the Carmel of Lisieux were cut down
altogether? I will fret no more about
transitory things; my Well-Beloved shall
take the place of all else for me.... I
will wander ever in the groves of His
love, which none may touch!’”</p>

<p>She said to her novices: “You are too
much taken up about what you are
doing, you torment yourselves concerning
the future as if you had the care of
it.... Are you at this moment preoccupied
with what is passing in other
Carmels, as to whether the nuns are
pressed or not? Do their labours hinder
your prayer or meditation? Very well,
so, too, ought you to be detached from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
your personal work, employing conscientiously
therein the time directed, but

building the walls of Jerusalem, worked
with one hand and with the other held
a sword.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> That is truly a figure of what
we ought to do: never give ourselves

<p>A novice asked some of the Sisters
to help to shake blankets, which being
rather worn, she cautioned them somewhat
sharply to be careful not to tear.
Sœur Thérèse remarked:</p>

<p>“What would you do if it were not
your office to mend these blankets?...
With what detachment you would then
act! And if you did point out that they
are easily torn, how free from self-interest
it would be. Thus, never let
the least shadow of self-interest glide
into your actions.”</p>

<p>In the infirmary the novices used
scarcely to wait till her thanksgivings
were ended before speaking to her and
seeking her counsels. This, at first,
grieved her and she gently reproached
them. Then very soon she let them
have their way, saying:</p>

<p>“The thought has struck me that I
am not to desire more of repose than our
Lord. When He retired into the desert
after His discourses, the people came
immediately to break in upon His solitude.
Come to me as much as you will.
I must die arms in hand, <i>having on my
lips the sword of the Spirit which is the
Word of God</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>“How do you manage so to practise
virtue,” asked a novice, “as to be always
the same, invariably joyous and composed?”</p>

<p>“It has not been always so,” she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>replied, “but ever since I have shunned
all self-seeking I lead the happiest life
that can be.”</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">COUNSELS AND REMINISCENCES</span><br>

<p>Now, that I am about to appear

I understand that there is but one
thing necessary: to work solely for Him,
and to do nothing for self or for creatures.</p>

<h2>MORTIFICATION</h2>


<p>Far from being like to those great
souls who from their childhood practise
all sorts of macerations, I made my
mortification consist solely in the breaking
of my will, restraining a hasty word,
rendering little services to those around
me without making anything of it, and
a thousand other things of this kind.</p>

<p class="author">

<p>As I had no taste for games, I should
have liked to spend my life reading, but
I was only to take a very limited time
for this chosen recreation, and this was
the ground of many a sacrifice, for I
made it a point of duty to break off
promptly at the end of the time allotted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
even in the middle of the most interesting
passage.</p>

<p class="author">

<p>I had accustomed myself never to
complain when anything of mine was

I chose rather to remain silent than to
defend myself.</p>

<p>I was ten years old the day that my
Father told Céline he was going to let
her have lessons in painting; I was by,
and envied her. Then Papa said to
me: “And you, my little queen, would
it give you pleasure too to learn drawing?”
I was just going to respond with
a very gladsome <i>yes</i>, when Marie made
the remark that I had not the same taste
for it as Céline. At once she gained the
day; and I, thinking that here was a
good opportunity of offering a grand
sacrifice to Jesus, said not a word. So
eager was my desire to learn drawing
that now I still wonder how I had the
fortitude to remain silent.</p>

<p>In the world, on awakening in the
morning I used to think over what would
probably occur either pleasing or vexatious
during the day; and if I foresaw
only trying events I arose dispirited.
Now it is quite the other way: I think of
the difficulties and the sufferings that
await me, and I rise the more joyous and
full of courage the more I foresee opportunities
of proving my love for Jesus, and
<i>earning the living of my children</i>—seeing
that I am <i>the mother</i> of souls. Then I
kiss my crucifix and lay it tenderly on
the pillow while I dress, and I say to
Him: “My Jesus, Thou hast worked
enough and wept enough during the
three-and-thirty years of Thy life on
this poor earth. Take now Thy rest....
My turn it is to suffer and to fight.”</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">COUNSELS AND REMINISCENCES</span><br>
</p>


<p>The attraction to penance was given
me, but I was permitted nothing to
satisfy it. The only mortifications I
was allowed consisted in mortifying self-love,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
which did me more good than
corporal penance.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">HIST. D’UNE AME, CH. VII</span><br>
</p>


<p>At prayer I was for a long time near a
Sister who used to handle incessantly
either her Rosary-beads or some other
thing; perhaps none heard it but myself,
for my hearing is extremely acute, but
I cannot say how it tormented me! I
should have liked to turn my head and
look at the culprit so as to make her
stop that noise: however in my heart
I knew it was better to bear it patiently,
for the love of God in the first place,
and also to avoid giving pain.</p>

<p>I kept quiet therefore, but was sometimes
worked up to fever-heat and
obliged to make simply a prayer of endurance.
Finally I sought out the means
of suffering with peace and joy, at least
in my innermost soul; I tried to like
the teasing little noise. Instead of endeavouring
not to hear it—a thing
impossible—I listened with fixed attention
as if it had been a delightful concert;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
and my prayer, <i>which was not the prayer
of quiet</i>, passed in offering this concert to
Jesus.</p>

<p>Another time I was in the laundry
opposite a Sister who while washing handkerchiefs
splashed me every minute with
dirty water. My first impulse was to
draw back and wipe my face, so as to
show her who besprinkled me in that
fashion, that she would oblige me by
working more quietly; but I reflected
immediately that it was very foolish to
refuse treasures so generously offered
me, and I took good care not to show my
annoyance. On the contrary, I made
such successful efforts to <i>wish</i> for a
plentiful splashing of dirty water, that
at the end of half an hour I had really
acquired a taste for this new sort of
aspersion, and I determined to come
again as often as possible to a place where
happily such riches could be had gratuitously.</p>

<p>I remember that sometimes, when
a postulant, I was so violently tempted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
to indulge myself by seeking some little
consolations, that I was obliged to go
quickly past our Mother’s cell, and cling
to the banisters of the staircase so that I
should not turn back. There would
come to mind a number of permissions
to ask, a hundred pretexts for deciding
in favour of my natural inclinations and
gratifying them. How glad I am now
of having denied myself from the outset
of my life in religion! Already I enjoy
the reward promised to those who fight
courageously. No longer do I feel the
necessity of refusing myself consolations
of the heart; for my heart is firmly fixed
in God.... Because it has loved Him
above all, it has gradually enlarged, even
so as to love those who are dear to it
with a love incomparably deeper than
if it were centred in a selfish and fruitless
affection.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">HIST. D’UNE AME, CH. X</span><br>
</p>


<p>In everything I must find self-denial
and sacrifice; thus I feel that a letter
will not bear fruit unless I write it with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
certain reluctance, and solely through
obedience. When conversing with a
novice I am careful to mortify myself
and to avoid asking her questions which
would gratify my curiosity. If she commence
to speak of something interesting,
then, leaving it unfinished, pass to a
subject wearisome to me, I take care not
to remind her of the interruption, for it
seems to me that one can do no good by
self-seeking.</p>

<p>God did not permit that our Mother
should tell me to write down my poems
according as I composed them, and I
would not have liked to ask her, fearing
lest that might be a fault against poverty.
So I used to wait until the hour of free
time, and it was not without extreme
difficulty that I recalled to mind, at
eight o’clock in the evening, what I had
composed in the morning.</p>

<p>These little nothings are a martyrdom
it is true, but we must be well on our
guard not to lessen it by allowing ourselves,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
or seeking to be allowed, a thousand
things which would render the
religious life pleasant and comfortable.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">COUNSELS AND REMINISCENCES</span><br>

<p>When some one rings for us, or
knocks at our door, we must mortify
ourselves so as not even to do one
stitch more before answering. I have
practised that; and it is, I assure you, a
source of peace.</p>

</p>


<p>Sœur Thérèse de l’Enfant Jésus says
that she has not done any great penances:
that is because her fervour counted as
nothing those which were allowed her.
It nevertheless happened that she became
ill from wearing for too long a time a
small iron cross, of which the sharp points
were sunk into her flesh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>“That would not have befallen me
from so slight a penance,” she said
afterwards, “if the good God had not
wanted to make me understand that the
macerations of the Saints are not intended
for me, nor for the little souls who
will tread the same path of spiritual
childhood.”</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">HIST. D’UNE AME, CH. XII</span><br>
</p>


<p>To a novice whom she saw practise a
little act of self-denial she said:</p>

<p>“You will be very glad to find that
before you at the moment of death.
What you have just done is more glorious
than if, by some skilful measures, you
had gained for the religious communities
the good-will of the Government, and
that all France applauded you as a
Judith.”</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">COUNSELS AND REMINISCENCES</span><br>
</p>


<p>To another who was bewailing her
want of courage:</p>

<p>“You complain of what should cause
you the greatest happiness. Where would
be your merit if you must fight only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
when you felt the courage? What matters
it if you have none, provided that
you act as if you had! If you feel too
slothful to pick up a bit of thread, and
that nevertheless you do it for the love
of Jesus, you have more merit than if in
a moment of fervour you were to accomplish
something of far greater importance.
So instead of being sorrowful, rejoice to
see that in letting you feel your weakness
the good Master provides you with an
opportunity of gaining for Him a greater
number of souls.”</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">COUNSELS AND REMINISCENCES</span><br>
</p>


<p>Being questioned as to her mode of
sanctifying the repasts, Thérèse made
answer:</p>

<p>“In the refectory we have but one only
thing to do: to accomplish this so lowly
act with thoughts uplifted. I declare
to you that often it is in the refectory
the sweetest aspirations of love come to
me. Sometimes I am impelled to dwell
on the thought that if our Divine Lord
were in my place, with the fare set before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
Him as served to me, He would certainly
partake of it.... It is very probable that
during His life on earth He tasted of the
like food: <i>He ate bread, fruits, etc.</i>...</p>

<p>“Here are my simple little rubrics:</p>

<p>“I picture myself at Nazareth in the
house of Holy Family. If I am served
with, for instance, salad, cold fish, wine
or anything of strong flavour, I offer it
to St. Joseph. To the Blessed Virgin
I give the hot portions, well-ripened
fruits, etc.; and the feast-day fare,
particularly corn-flour, rice, preserves,
these I offer to the Child Jesus. Lastly,
when a bad dinner is brought me I say
gaily to myself: ‘Today, my dear little
child, all that is for you.’”</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">COUNSELS AND REMINISCENCES</span><br>
</p>


<p>One fast-day when the Mother
Prioress had ordered some special little
thing by way of alleviation for Sœur
Thérèse, a Sister relates that she surprised
her in the act of seasoning this too
palatable fare with wormwood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>Another time she saw her slowly
drinking some particularly disagreeable
physic, and exclaimed: “But be quick,
drink that off at one draught!” “Oh
no!” was the reply, “must I not take
advantage of the trifling opportunities
I meet with, to mortify myself a little,
since it is forbidden me to look for
greater?”</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">COUNSELS AND REMINISCENCES</span><br>

<p>An extremely interesting letter had
been read one day at the recreation in
the absence of Thérèse who later showed
a desire to read it. Some time afterwards
when returning the letter, she was
begged to say what she thought regarding
something which should especially have
delighted her. She appeared embarrassed
and then replied:</p>

<p>“The good God has asked of me this
sacrifice because of the eagerness that I
manifested the other day; I have not
read it....”</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">COUNSELS AND REMINISCENCES</span><br>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>


<p>She told the novices: “At recreation
more than elsewhere will you find occasions
for the exercise of virtue. If you
would reap great benefit, never go to it
with any thought of your own recreation,
but thinking of the recreation of others;
practise therein total detachment from
yourself. If, for instance, you are relating
to one of the Sisters a story which seems
to you interesting, and that she interrupts
it to tell you something else, even though
this may not at all interest you, listen
to her as if it did, and do not try to return
to your first subject. By so acting, you
will go from the recreation room with
great interior peace, and endued with
fresh vigour in the practice of virtue, all
because you have not sought to gratify
yourself but to give pleasure to others.
If one only knew what is gained by
renouncing self in all things!...”</p>

<p>“You know it well; you have always
acted thus?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have forgotten self, I have
tried not to seek myself in anything.”</p>

<h2>OBEDIENCE</h2>

<p>From what anxieties do we not free
ourselves by making the vow of obedience!
How happy are single-minded
religious. Their sole guide being the
will of Superiors, they are ever secure
of going the right way without fear of
error, should it even appear to them
certain that the Superiors are mistaken.
But when one ceases to consult the sure
compass, the soul forthwith loses her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
way in arid paths where the waters of
grace soon fail her.</p>

<p>During her illness the Infirmarian
had recommended Sœur Thérèse to take
a little walk in the garden every day for
a quarter of an hour. For her, this
advice was a command. One afternoon,
a Sister seeing her walk with much
difficulty said to her: “You would do
far better to rest; in such circumstances
walking can do you no good, you exhaust
yourself, that is all.”</p>

<p>“It is true,” replied this child of
Obedience, “but do you know what
gives me strength?... Well! <i>I walk
for a Missionary.</i> I think how some one
of them far away, yonder, is perhaps
exhausted in his apostolic journeyings,
and to lessen his fatigue I offer mine to
the good God.”</p>

<h2>POVERTY</h2>


<p>After I was clothed with the holy
Habit abundant lights on religious perfection
were granted me, chiefly regarding
the vow of poverty. During my postulate
I was pleased to have for my use,
anything that was nice, and to find at
my hand whatever was necessary. Jesus
bore with this patiently, for He does not
like to disclose all to the soul at once.
He ordinarily gives His light little by
little.</p>

<p>After Compline one evening I looked
in vain for our lantern on the shelves
appointed for them; it was the time of
great silence, not possible therefore to
ask for it back. I rightly supposed that
a Sister believing she took her own had
carried away ours; but must I spend a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
whole hour in the dark in consequence of
this mistake? And just that evening I
had intended doing much work. Without
the interior light of grace I should
assuredly have bewailed my loss, but
with that light, instead of experiencing
vexation I was happy in thinking that
poverty consists in being deprived not
only of things desirable, but of those
also that are indispensable. And in
the exterior darkness I found my soul
illumined with divine light.</p>

<p>I was seized at this time with a genuine
love for what was ugliest and least convenient,
thus I was delighted when I saw
the pretty little jug carried off from our
cell, and received in its stead a large one,
all chipped.</p>

<h2>CONFIDENCE</h2>

<span class="allsmcap">I LETTER TO HER COUSIN MARIE GUÉRIN</span><br>

<p>Believing that I was born for
glory, and seeking the means to attain
to it, it was revealed to me interiorly
that my glory would never be visible to
mortal eyes but would consist in becoming
a saint. This desire might well
seem presumptuously bold, considering
how imperfect I was, and how imperfect
I am still after so many years in religion;
and yet I feel ever the same audacious
confidence of becoming a great saint.
I count not on my merits, having none;
but I trust in Him who is Virtue and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
Holiness itself. He alone it is who
satisfied with my feeble efforts will raise
me up even unto Himself, will clothe me
with His merits and make me a saint.</p>

<p>Ours is an age of inventions: nowadays,
with the rich a lift saves the
trouble of climbing the stairs. And I,
fain would I too find a <i>lift</i> to bear me
up unto God, for I am too little to climb
the rugged steps of perfection.</p>

<p>Then I turned to the Holy Scriptures,
seeking from them an indication of this
<i>lift</i>, the object of my desires; and I read
these words which have issued from the
very mouth of the Eternal Wisdom:
“<i>Whosoever is a</i> <span class="allsmcap">VERY LITTLE ONE</span>, <i>let
him come to me</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Then I drew nigh
unto God divining truly that I had
discovered what I sought: wishing however
to know what He would do with the
<i>very little one</i>, I continued my research
and here is what I found: “<i>You shall be
carried at the breast and upon the knees;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
as one whom the mother caresseth so will I
comfort you</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>Ah, never came words more sweet,
more tender, to gladden my soul. Thine
arms then, O Jesus, are the <i>lift</i> which
must raise me up even unto Heaven!
For this I need not grow, on the contrary
I must remain little, I must ever
tend to become yet more little. O my
God, Thou hast gone beyond my expectations,
and I—I will sing Thy
mercies! <i>Thou hast taught me, O God
from my youth: and till now I have declared
Thy wondrous works. And unto old age
and grey hairs</i><a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> will I proclaim them.</p>

Jesus, I own that it has chased all fear
from mine! The remembrance of my
faults humiliates me, and urges me
never to depend upon my own strength
which is nothing but weakness: still
more does this remembrance speak to me
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>of mercy and of love. When, with all
filial confidence we cast our faults into
the devouring furnace of love, how
should they not be totally consumed?</p>

<p>Though we must needs be pure
indeed to appear in the presence of the
God of all Holiness, yet I know too that
He is infinitely just; and this justice
which affrights so many souls is the
ground of my joy and my confidence.
Justice not merely exercises severity
towards the offender; it moreover recognizes
a right intention, and awards to
virtue its recompense. I hope as much
from the Justice of the good God as
from His Mercy; it is because He is
just, that “<i>He is compassionate and
merciful, long-suffering and plenteous in
mercy. For He knoweth our frame. He
remembereth that we are but dust. As a
father hath compassion on His children, so
hath the Lord compassion on us!</i>”<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>...</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>
<p>Listening to these beautiful and consoling
words of the Royal Prophet, how
can we doubt but that the good God
will open the portals of His Kingdom
to His children who have loved Him
even unto sacrificing all for Him, who
have not only left their kindred and
their country, for the sake of making
Him known and loved, but, still further,
desire to give their life for Him?...
Most truly has Jesus said that there is
no greater love than this! How then
could He suffer Himself to be outdone
in generosity? How could He purify in
the flames of Purgatory souls consumed
by the fire of Divine Love?...</p>

<p>That is what I think of the justice of
the good God; my way is all confidence
and love, I do not understand those souls
who fear so tender a Friend.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">VI LETTER TO HER MISSIONARY “BROTHERS”</span><br>

<p>That joy to think that God is just,
that is to say, that He takes our weakness
into consideration, that He thoroughly
knows the frailty of our nature. Of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
what then, should I be afraid? Must
not the good and infinitely just God,
who with such tender mercy deigns to
pardon the Prodigal Son, must He not
be just towards me too—<i>who am always
with Him</i>?<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>I want to make you understand by a
very simple comparison how much Jesus
loves souls, even the imperfect, who
trust in Him. Suppose the father of
two wayward and disobedient children,
coming to punish them, sees one tremble
and draw away from him in terror;
while the other, on the contrary, throwing
himself into his arms, says he is
sorry, promises to be good henceforward
and begs for a kiss as punishment. Do
you think the delighted father will
withstand the filial confidence of this
child? He knows nevertheless that his
son will fall again many a time into the
same faults, but he is disposed to pardon
him always, if always there be an appeal
to his heart.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>
<p>I say nothing of the other child: you
must understand that his father cannot
love him as much or treat him with the
same indulgence.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">VIII LETTER TO HER MISSIONARY “BROTHERS”</span><br>

<p>Truly the Heart of Jesus is more
grieved by the thousand little imperfections
of His friends than by even grave
faults of His enemies. But it seems
to me that it is only when His own
chosen ones make a habit of these infidelities,
and do not ask His pardon,
that He can say: “<i>These wounds which
you see in the midst of My Hands: with
these was I wounded in the house of them
that loved Me.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>For those who love Him and who
come after each little fault and throw
themselves into His arms, begging His
forgiveness, the Heart of Jesus thrills
with joy. He says to His Angels what
the father of the prodigal son said to
His servants: “<i>Put a ring on his finger
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>and let us rejoice.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Oh! the goodness
and the merciful love of the Heart of
Jesus, how little is it known! True it
is, that to share in these treasures we
must humble ourselves, must acknowledge
our nothingness, and that is what many
souls are unwilling to do.</p>

<p>Truly I am far from being a saint.
I ought not to rejoice at the aridity of
my soul, but attribute it to the scantiness
of my fervour and fidelity. I
ought to grieve because I fall asleep very
often during my prayer and my thanksgiving.
Well, I do not grieve! I reflect
that little children when they sleep are
as pleasing to their parents as when they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>are awake; that in order to perform

<p>It is confidence, and confidence alone,

<p>It is not because I have been shielded
from mortal sin that I lift up my heart
to God in trust and love. I feel that
even if there lay upon my conscience all
the crimes one could commit I should
lose nothing of my confidence. Broken-hearted
with compunction I would go and
throw myself into the arms of my Saviour.
I know that He cherished the Prodigal
Son, I have heard His words to Mary
Magdalene, to the adultress, to the
Samaritan woman. No one could
frighten me, for I know what to believe
concerning His Mercy and His Love.
I know that in one moment all that
multitude of sins would disappear—as
a drop of water cast into a red-hot furnace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>It is related in the Lives of the Fathers
of the Desert that one of them converted
a public sinner whose misdeeds scandalized
the whole country. Touched by
grace this sinful woman was following
the saint into the desert, there to do
rigorous penance, when, on the first
night of her journey, before she had
even reached the place of her retreat,
the bonds of life were broken by the
impetuosity of her loving contrition.
The holy hermit at the same moment
saw her soul borne by Angels into the
Bosom of God.</p>

<p>That is truly a striking instance of
what I want to express, but one cannot
put these things into words....</p>

THÉRÈSE OF THE CHILD JESUS<br>

(<i>The Little Flower of Jesus</i>)</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>One evening as they were telling her
something which had been said at recreation,
touching the responsibility of those
who have the charge of souls, Sœur
Thérèse de l’Enfant Jésus spoke these
beautiful words: “‘<i>To him that is little,
mercy is granted.</i>’<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> It is possible to
remain <i>little</i>, even in the most important
offices; and is it not written that at the
end <i>the Lord will arise to save the meek
and humble of the earth</i>?<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> It says not
to <i>judge</i> but to <i>save</i>.”</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">HIST. D’UNE AME, CH. XII</span><br>
</p>


<p>A novice questioning as to whether
our Lord were not dissatisfied with her
on account of her many miseries, Sœur
Thérèse made answer:</p>

<p>“Set your mind at rest: He whom
you have chosen as your Spouse possesses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
certainly every perfection that can be
desired; but, if I may dare to say it,
He has at the same time one great infirmity:
<i>He is blind!</i> And there is a
science which He knows not, that of
<i>calculation</i>. These two points which
would be most lamentable deficiencies in
an earthly spouse, render ours infinitely
lovable. Were He to consider our sins
and reckon with them, do you not think
that in the face of all these sins He
would cast us back into nothingness?
But no, His love for us makes Him absolutely
blind!</p>

<p>“See for yourself: if the greatest
sinner on earth, at the hour of death
repent of his transgressions and expire
in an act of love, immediately, without
calculating on the one hand the numerous
graces abused by this unhappy man, nor
on the other, all his crimes, Jesus sees
nothing, counts nothing, but the penitent’s
last prayer, and delays not to
receive him into the arms of His Mercy.</p>

<p>“But to render Him thus blind, to
hinder Him from doing the least little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
bit of reckoning, we must know how to
lay siege to His Heart; at that point
He is defenceless....”</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">COUNSELS AND REMINISCENCES</span><br>
</p>


<p>To another, who bitterly repented of
a fault just committed, Sœur Thérèse
said:</p>

<p>“Take your Crucifix and kiss it.”</p>

<p>The novice kissed the feet.</p>

<p>“Is that how a child embraces her
Father? Put your arms round His Neck
immediately and kiss His Face.”</p>

<p>She obeyed.</p>

<p>“That is not all, He must return your
caresses.”</p>

<p>And she had to hold the Crucifix to
each cheek; then Thérèse said:</p>

<p>“That is well, now all is forgiven!”</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">COUNSELS AND REMINISCENCES</span><br>
</p>


<p>Having caused her pain, a novice
went to ask pardon of Sœur Thérèse,
who replied with emotion: “If you only
knew what I feel! Never have I so well
understood with what love Jesus receives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
us, when, after a fault we beg Him to
forgive us. If I, His poor little creature,
feel such tenderness for you the moment
you return to me, what must pass in the
Heart of the good God when we return
to Him?... Yes, surely, more swiftly
yet than I have just done, will He forget
all our iniquities, never again to remember
them.... He will do even more—He
will love us still better than before our
fault!...”</p>

<h2>SELF-ABANDONMENT</h2>


<p>I cannot think without rapture of
the dear little Saint Cæcilia: what a
model! In the midst of a pagan world,
in the heart of danger, at the moment
when about to be united to a mortal
who sought none but earthly love, it
seems to me that she ought to have
trembled and wept. But no, <i>while her
bridal was celebrated with joyful melody
Cæcilia was singing in her heart</i>.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> What
abandonment to God! Without doubt
she listened to other melodies than those
of earth; her Divine Spouse, He too, was
singing, and Angel choirs sang again the
refrain of one most blessed night: “<i>Glory
to God in the highest and on earth peace to
men of good will.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>The glory of God!—Oh! Cæcilia
understood it; most earnestly did she
long for it. She divined that her Jesus
was athirst for souls ... that is why
her whole desire was that she might lead
speedily to Him the soul of the young
Roman, who dreamed of naught but
human glory: this wise Virgin will make
of him a martyr, and multitudes will
follow in his footprints. She fears nothing:
the Angels have promised and have
sung of peace. She knows that the
Prince of Peace is bound to protect her,
to shield her virginity and to give to her
its recompense. “<i>O how beautiful is the
chaste generation!</i>”<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>I had offered myself to the Child

would a little ball of no value, that He
might throw to the ground, toss about,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
pierce, leave in a corner, or else press to
His Heart if so it pleased Him. In a

<p>My heart is entirely filled with the will
of Jesus; therefore when anything over
and above falls to its share, this does not
penetrate to its depths; it is a mere
nothing which easily glides by, as oil
on the surface of limpid water. Ah! if
my heart were not filled up beforehand,
had it to be filled by the sentiments of
joy or of sadness which so quickly
succeed each other, bitter indeed would
be this flood-tide of pain; but these
rapid alternations do no more than
ruffle the surface of my soul, and I remain
ever in a profound peace that nothing
can disturb.</p>

<p class="author">

<p>I am not always faithful, but I am never

and ill that He finds in me</i>.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> He teaches
me to speculate in the Bank of Love,
or rather it is He who acts for me without
telling me how He goes to work, that is
His affair and not mine; my part is
complete surrender, reserving nothing to
myself, not even the gratification of
knowing how my credit stands with the
Bank.</p>

<p>A sister told Sœur Thérèse of the
strange phenomena produced by magnetism
on persons who really wish to
yield up their will to the mesmerizer.
These details appeared to interest her
keenly and on the morrow she said to
the Sister:</p>

<p>“Your conversation yesterday did me
so much good. Oh! how I wish to be
magnetized by our Lord. It was my
first thought on awakening. With what
delight have I delivered my will up to
Him. Yes, I want Him to make Himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
master of my faculties in such sort that
my actions shall no longer be human or
personal, but wholly divine, inspired and
directed by the Spirit of Love.”</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">COUNSELS AND REMINISCENCES</span><br>
</p>


<p>You are quite wrong to think of
sorrows that the future may bring;
it is, as it were, intermeddling with
Divine Providence. We who run in
the way of Love must never torment
ourselves about anything. If I did not
suffer minute by minute, it would be
impossible for me to be patient; but I
see only the present moment, I forget
the past and I take good care not to
anticipate the future. If we grow disheartened,
if sometimes we despair, it is
because we have been dwelling on the
past or the future.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">HIST. D’UNE AME, CH. XII</span><br>

<p>I no longer thirst for either suffering or
death, yet both I dearly prize. Long
did I call upon them as the harbingers of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
joy.... Suffering has in very truth been
mine, and I have thought I wellnigh
touched the eternal shore! I have believed
from my earliest youth that <i>the
little flower</i> would be gathered in its
spring-time; now, it is the spirit of self-abandonment
alone that guides me, no
other compass have I. I know not
now, how to ask anything eagerly, save
the perfect accomplishment of God’s
designs upon my soul.</p>

<p>“Pray for me,” she would often say,
“when I implore Heaven to come to my
aid, then it is that I feel most forsaken.”</p>

<p>“And in this desolation how do you
avoid discouragement?” they asked her.</p>

<p>“I turn to the good God, to all the
Saints, and I thank them just the same.
I think they wish to see to what point
I shall carry my trust.... But not in
vain have these words of Job sunk into
my heart: ‘<i>Though He should kill me yet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>will I trust in Him</i>.’<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> I acknowledge it

abandonment; our Lord has taken me
and placed me there!”</p>

<p>It seems to me that nothing now
hinders me from taking flight, for I no
longer have any great desires, save to
love, even unto dying of love. I am
free, I have no fear, not even of what I
most dreaded; I mean the fear of being
a long time ill and consequently a burthen
to the Community. If it gives pleasure
to the good God I willingly consent to
see my life of suffering, both of soul and
body, prolonged for years. Oh! no, I
do not fear a long life. I do not shun
the combat. “<i>The Lord is the rock upon
which I am founded. Who teacheth my
hands to fight and my fingers to war;
He is my protector in whom I have hoped.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
Never have I asked God to let me die
young; it is true I have ever believed
that it would be so, but without seeking
to obtain it.</p>

<h2>GRATITUDE</h2>


<p>Oh, how happy God makes me!
How easy and how sweet it is to serve
Him upon earth.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">HIST. D’UNE AME, CH. X</span><br>
</p>


<p>Seeing several of my companions
form special attachments to some one or
other of our mistresses, I wished to
follow their example but could not
succeed therein. O happy inability! from
how great evils has it saved me.... How
I thank God for having made me find
only bitterness in the friendships of
earth. With a heart such as mine I
should have been captured and had my
wings clipped; then how should I have
been able to <i>fly away and be at rest</i>.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<span class="allsmcap">HIST. D’UNE AME, CH. IV</span><br>
</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>I understand well that our Lord
knew I was too weak to be exposed to
temptation; without doubt I should
have been wholly destroyed had I been
dazzled by the deceitful glamour of the
love of creatures; but never has it shone
before my eyes. There, where strong
souls find joy, and through fidelity
detach themselves from it, I have found
only affliction. Where then is my merit
in not being given up to these fragile
attachments, since it is only by a gracious
effect of God’s mercy that I was preserved
from it? Without Him, I recognize
that I might have fallen as low as St.
Magdalene; and that word of deep
meaning spoken by the Divine Master
to Simon the Pharisee, re-echoes with
great sweetness in my soul. Yes, I
know it: “<i>To whom less is forgiven, he
loveth less.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> But I also know that
Jesus has forgiven more to me than to
St. Magdalene. Ah, how I wish I could
express what I feel. Here at least is an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
example which will in some measure
convey my thought.</p>

<p>Suppose the son of a skilful doctor is
tripped by a stone in his path, which
causes him to fall and fracture a limb.
His father comes in haste, lifts him up
lovingly and attends to his injuries,
employing therein all the resources of
his art; and the boy, very soon completely
cured, testifies his gratitude.
This child has certainly good reason to
love so kind a father; but here is another
supposition.</p>

<p>The father having learnt that there
lies in his son’s way a dangerous stone,
sets out beforehand and removes it
unseen by anyone. His son, the object
of this tender forethought, unaware of
the misfortune from which he has been
preserved by the father’s hand, will of
course show no gratitude, and will love
him less than if he had cured him of a
grievous wound. But should he come
to know all, will he not love him still
more? Well—I am this child, the
object of the preventing love of a Father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
<i>Who sent His Son not to redeem the just
but sinners</i>.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> He wills that I should love
Him because He has forgiven me, not
<i>much</i>, but <i>everything</i>. Without waiting
for me to love Him much, like St. Mary
Magdalene, He has made me to know
how He had loved me with a preventing
and ineffable love, in order that I may
now love Him even unto folly!</p>

<p>Walking one day in the garden,
leaning on one of her sisters, Thérèse
paused to enjoy the fascinating sight of
a little white hen sheltering its chickens
beneath its wings. Very soon her eyes
filled with tears, and turning to her dear
companion she said: “I can stay no
longer, let us go in again quickly....”
And in her cell, her tears continued
falling and she could not utter a word.
At last, looking at her sister with an
expression that was quite heavenly, she
said:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>
<p>“I was thinking of our Lord, and of
the touching comparison He chose in
order to make us believe in His tenderness.
That is just what He has done
for me all my life: <i>He has wholly hidden
me beneath His wings!</i> I cannot express
what passed within my heart. Ah! the
good God does well to veil Himself from
my sight, to show me the effects of His
Mercy rarely, and as it were, ‘<i>through
the lattices</i>;’<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> such consolations would,
I feel, be more than I could bear.”</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">HIST. D’UNE AME, CH. XII</span><br>
</p>


<p>“Oh! how <i>good</i> is the good God!” ...
she would sometimes exclaim. “Yes,
He must indeed be good to give me the
strength to endure all that I suffer.”</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">HIST. D’UNE AME, CH. XII</span><br>
</p>


<p>One day she said to the Mother
Prioress:</p>

<p>“I would like to speak to you, Mother,
of the state of my soul; but I cannot,
I am too deeply moved just now.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>
<p>And in the evening she sent these lines
pencilled with a trembling hand:</p>

<p>“O my God, how good Thou art to
the little victim of Thy Merciful Love!
Now even though Thou dost join physical
suffering to the trials of my soul, I cannot
say: ‘<i>The sorrows of death have encompassed
me.</i>’<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> But I cry out in my
gratitude: ‘<i>I have gone down into the
valley of the shadow of death, yet I fear no
evil, because Thou, O Lord, art with me.</i>’”<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<h2>ZEAL</h2>


<p>The cry of Jesus agonizing, “I
thirst!” re-echoed continually in my
heart, firing it with an ardent zeal till
then unknown to me. I longed to give
to my Beloved to drink: I too felt
myself consumed with the thirst for
souls, and at all cost I would wrest
sinners from the eternal flames.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">HIST. D’UNE AME, CH. V</span><br>
</p>


<p>The Precious Blood of Jesus I poured
on souls, to Him I offered these same
souls renewed by the Dew of Calvary;
thus I thought to quench His Thirst;
but the more I gave Him to drink, the
more ardently my poor little soul thirsted—and
this I received as a most precious
recompense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>


<p>Like the Prophets and the Doctors
I would fain enlighten souls. Fain would
I travel the earth, O my Well-Beloved,
to preach Thy Name and to set up Thy
glorious Cross in Pagan lands. But one
mission only would not suffice for me;
would that I could at one and the same
time proclaim the Gospel all the world
over, even to the remotest of its islands.
I would desire to be a Missionary not
only for a few years, but to have been
one from the creation of the world, and
so to continue to the end of time.</p>

<p>I long to accomplish the most heroic

<p>Souls—dear Lord, we must have
souls! Above all, souls of apostles and

<p>After recreation one day when the
Mother Prioress had spoken of the
persecution already raging against Religious
Communities, Sœur Thérèse said
to a novice: “Ah! Sister, we live in an
era of martyrs! Blood will be shed.—What
happiness if it should be ours!”</p>

<p>A novice on her way to the laundry
one day, went at a slow pace through
the garden, looking at the flowers as
she passed. Sœur Thérèse who followed
walking quickly, soon overtook her and
said: “Is that how one hastens who has
children (<i>souls</i>) to support, for whose
sustenance she is obliged to work?...”</p>

<p>During her illness she wrote:</p>

<p>“The will of the good God is my sole
desire; and I declare that if in Heaven
I could no longer work for His glory, I
would choose exile rather than the
Fatherland.”</p>

<span class="allsmcap">IV LETTER TO HER MISSIONARY “BROTHERS”</span><br>
</p>


<p>What draws me towards the Heavenly
Country is the call of our Lord, the hope
of at last loving Him as I have so ardently
desired, and the thought that I shall be
able to make Him loved by <i>a multitude
of souls</i> who will bless Him eternally.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">VIII LETTER TO HER MISSIONARY “BROTHERS”</span><br>
</p>


<p>Confidently I count upon not
remaining inactive in Heaven, my desire
is to work still for the Church and for
souls: this I ask of God, and I am certain
that He will hear me. If I quit already
the battlefield, it is not with the selfish
desire of taking my rest. Suffering has
long since become my heaven here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
below, and it is difficult to imagine how
it will be possible for me to become
acclimatized to a country where joy
reigns, unmingled with sorrow. Jesus
must needs transform my soul completely,
else I could not support eternal
bliss.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">HIST. D’UNE AME, CH. XII</span><br>
</p>


<p>Just now a few notes of distant music
fell upon my ear, and set me thinking
that very soon I shall hear melodies
beyond compare; yet this thought can
give me but a moment’s gladness; one
only expectation makes my heart throb:
<i>it is the love that I shall receive and the
love that I shall be able to give!</i></p>

<p><i>I feel that my mission is now to begin,
my mission to make others love the good
God as I love Him ... to give to souls my
little way.</i> <span class="smcap">I will spend my heaven in
doing good upon earth.</span> This is not
impossible, since the Angels in the full
enjoyment of the Beatific Vision keep
watch over us. No, I shall never rest
till the end of the world! But when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
the Angel shall have said: “Time is no
more!”<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> then I shall rest—shall be
able to rejoice, because the number of
the elect will be complete.</p>

<h2>SIMPLICITY</h2>


<p>When I read certain treatises where
perfection is set forth as encompassed
by a thousand obstacles, my poor little
head grows weary very quickly. I close
the learned book which puzzles my
brains and dries up my heart, and in its
stead I open the Holy Scriptures. Then
all appears clear, luminous ... one single
word discloses to my soul infinite horizons,
perfection seems easy. I see that it is
sufficient to recognize our nothingness,
and to leave oneself like a child, in the
arms of the good God. Let great souls
and sublime intellects enjoy the beautiful
books which I cannot understand, still
less put in practice; I rejoice in being
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>little, since “<i>children only and those who
resemble them will be admitted to the
Heavenly banquet</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>It is well that the Kingdom of Heaven
contains many mansions, for if there
were none other than those of which the
description and the way seem incomprehensible
to me, I should never be
able to enter therein.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">VI LETTER TO HER MISSIONARY “BROTHERS”</span><br>
</p>


<p>My patrons in Heaven and my chosen
favourites are those who have stolen it—like
the Holy Innocents and the Good
Thief. The great Saints have earned it
by their works; as for me, I will imitate
the thieves, I will have it by ruse, a ruse
of Love which will open its gates to me
and to poor sinners. The Holy Ghost
encourages me, saying in the Book of
Proverbs: “<i>O little one, come, learn
subtlety of me.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>Our Lord replied to the mother of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>the sons of Zebedee: “<i>To sit on My
right and on My left hand is for them for
whom it is prepared by My Father.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
I imagine that those places of choice,
refused to great Saints, to Martyrs, will
be the portion of little children.</p>

<p>Did not David predict it when he said
that <i>the little Benjamin will preside
amidst the assemblies</i> (of the saints)?<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>“If you could begin your religious life
over again” asked a novice, “what
would you do?”</p>

<p>“It seems to me that I would do as I
have done.”</p>

<p>“You do not then feel like the hermit
who used to say: ‘Even though I had
lived long years in penance yet I should
fear damnation while there still remained
to me one quarter of an hour, one breath
of life.’”</p>

<p>“No, I cannot share that fear, I am
too little to be damned, little children
are not damned.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>“You always seek to be like the little
ones—but tell us what we must do to
possess the spirit of childhood? What
does it exactly mean—to remain
little?”</p>

<p>“To remain little—it is to recognize
our nothingness, to expect everything
from the good God, not to be too much
afflicted about our faults, for little children
fall often but are too small to hurt themselves
much: in fine, it is <i>not</i> to make
one’s fortune, nor to be disquieted about
anything. Even in the homes of the
poor, as long as a child is quite little they
give him what is needful; but when
grown up, the father is no longer willing
to support him and says: ‘Now work!
you can provide for yourself.’ Well, it
was to escape hearing that, that I have
never wished to grow up, for I know
myself incapable of earning my livelihood—Eternal
Life!</p>

<p>“Again, to remain little is not to
attribute to self the virtues we practise;
but to acknowledge that the good God
places this treasure in the hand of His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
little child to be made use of when
required.”</p>

<p>Be not afraid to tell Jesus that you
love Him; even though it be without
feeling, this is the way to oblige Him
to help you, and carry you like a little
child too feeble to walk.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">COUNSELS AND REMINISCENCES</span><br>
</p>


<p>It is a great trial to see only the black
side of things, but that does not depend
completely upon you. Do your best to
detach your heart from the cares of this
world, and above all from creatures;
then you may be sure that Jesus will do
the rest. He could not suffer you to
fall into the abyss. Be comforted, little
one, in Heaven you will no longer see
<i>all black</i> but <i>all white</i>; yes, all will be
clothed with the divine whiteness of our
Spouse, the Lily of the Valley. Together
we shall follow Him whithersoever He
goeth.... Oh! let us profit by the brief
moments of this life to give pleasure to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
Jesus, let us win souls for Him by our
sacrifices. Above all let us be little, so
little that all the world may trample us
under foot without even our appearing
to feel it or to suffer from it.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">COUNSELS AND REMINISCENCES</span><br>
</p>


<p>You are wrong to find fault with one
thing and another, and to seek that all
should yield to your way of viewing
things. We want to be like little children,
and little children know not what is
best, to them all seems well; let us
imitate them. Besides there would be
no merit [in obedience] were we only
to do what would appear reasonable to
us.</p>

<p>A novice under a temptation which
seemed to her insurmountable said:
“This time I cannot rise above it—it is
impossible.” Thérèse replied: “Why do
you try to rise above it? Pass beneath
it quite simply. It is very well for great
souls to soar high above the clouds when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
the storm is raging, but for us, we have
merely to bear the showers with patience.
If we do get rather wet—no matter!
We shall dry ourselves afterwards in the
sunshine of Love.”</p>

<p>That brings to mind this little trait
of my childhood; a horse one day standing
at the garden gate barred our entrance;
those with me endeavoured by
force of talking, etc., to get him to move
back, but while they talked I very
quietly slipped in, through the horse’s
legs.... See how one may gain by
remaining little!</p>

<p>To a young Sister discouraged at
seeing her imperfections, Sœur Thérèse
said: “You make me think of a very
little child who is just able to stand
upright but does not yet know how to
walk. Intent upon reaching the top of
the stairs so as to get back to his mother
he lifts his foot to climb the first step.
Fruitless endeavour! At each attempt
he falls without advancing in the least.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
Well, be like that little child; by the
practice of every virtue keep on ever
lifting your little foot to climb the steps
of sanctity, and do not imagine that you
will be able to mount even the first!
No; but good will is all God requires of
you. From the top of those steps He is
watching you with love; and won by
your unavailing efforts He will Himself
soon come down, and taking you in His
arms will bear you away to His Kingdom,
never more to quit Him. But if you
cease to lift your little foot He will leave
you a long time on earth.”</p>

<p>Someone was speaking to her of the
mortifications of the Saints, she replied:</p>

<p>“It is well our Lord has let us know
that <i>there are many mansions in His
Father’s House, that if not He would have
told us</i>.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Yes, if all souls called to
perfection had been obliged to practise
these macerations in order to enter
Heaven, He would have said so, and
gladly would we have undertaken them.
But He tells us that <i>in His House there
are many mansions</i>. If there are those
for great souls, for the Fathers of the
Desert and for martyrs of penance,
there must be one also for little children.
Our place is reserved there, if our love
be great—for Him and for our Heavenly
Father and the Spirit of Love.”</p>

<p>“I feel that my mission is now to

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>
<p>“What is this ‘little way’ that you
want to teach to souls?”</p>

<p>“<i>It is the path of spiritual childhood, it
is the way of trust and of entire self-surrender.</i>
I want to make known to them
the simple means that have so perfectly
succeeded for me, to tell them that there
is but one only thing to do here below:
<i>to cast down before Jesus the flowers of
little sacrifices, to win Him by caresses!</i>
That is how I have won Him, and that
is why I shall be so well received.”</p>

<p>If I am misguiding you by my <i>little

return, believe in the truth of my words:

<p>A novice said to her on the eve of
the Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel:
“If you were to die to-morrow after
Holy Communion, it seems to me that so
beautiful a death would console me in

<p>And Thérèse replied with animation:</p>

<p>“Die after Holy Communion! On a

things; all that I do, little souls must be
able to do also.”</p>

<h2>PRAYER</h2>


<p>As I grew older I loved the good God
more and more, and very frequently
did I offer Him my heart, using the
words my mother had taught me. I
strove in all my actions to please Jesus
and was most watchful never to offend
Him.</p>

<p>My whole strength lies in prayer and
sacrifice, these are my invincible arms;
they can move hearts far better than
words, I know it by experience.</p>

<p>Great is the power of prayer—a
queen, as one might say, having free<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
access always to the King, and able to
obtain whatever she asks. In order to
be heard, it is not necessary to read from
a book a beautiful form of prayer adapted
to the circumstances; if it were so, how
greatly to be pitied should I be!</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">HIST. D’UNE AME, CH. X</span><br>
</p>


<p>I have not the courage to force myself
to seek beautiful prayers in books;
not knowing which to choose I act as
children do who cannot read; I say
quite simply to the good God what I
want to tell Him, and He always understands
me.</p>

<p>Prayer is, for me, an outburst from
the heart; it is a simple glance darted
upwards to Heaven; it is a cry of gratitude
and of love in the midst of trial as
in the midst of joy! In a word, it is
something exalted, supernatural, which
dilates the soul and unites it to God.
Sometimes when I find myself, spiritually,
in dryness so great that I cannot produce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
a single good thought, I recite very
slowly a <i>Pater</i> or an <i>Ave Maria</i>; these
prayers alone console me, they suffice,
they nourish my soul.</p>

<p>The principal plenary indulgence and
one which all may gain without the
ordinary conditions, is that of <i>charity
which covereth a multitude of sins</i>.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

</p>


<p>Formerly if any of my family
were in trouble, and that I had been
unable to succeed in comforting them
during their visit, I would go from the
parlour heart-broken; but soon Jesus
made me understand that I was incapable
of giving consolation to a soul. From
that day forth I grieved no more when
anyone went away sad; I confided to
the good God the sorrows of those who
were dear to me, feeling certain that He
heard me, and at their next visit I used
to find that it had indeed been so. Since<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
I have experienced this, I no longer
torment myself when involuntarily I
give pain; I simply beg of Jesus to make
up for what I have done.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">COUNSELS AND REMINISCENCES</span><br>
</p>


<p>One day after Holy Communion the
good God made me understand those
words of the Canticles: “<i>Draw me: we
will run after Thee to the odour of Thy
ointments.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> O Jesus, it is not then
necessary to say: In drawing me, draw
the souls whom I love. These simple
words: “<i>Draw me</i>” suffice! Yes, when
a soul has allowed herself to be captivated
by the inebriating fragrance of Thy
perfumes, she could not run alone, all
the souls whom she loves are drawn after
her; this is a natural consequence of her
attraction towards Thee.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">HIST. D’UNE AME, CH. XI</span><br>
</p>


<p>“<i>Draw me, we will run....</i>”</p>

<p>To ask to be drawn is to will intimate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
union with the object which holds the
heart captive. If fire and iron were
gifted with reason, and that the latter
said to the fire: “Draw me,” would not
this prove that it desired to become
identified with the fire even so far as to
share its substance? Well, that is exactly
my prayer. I beg of Jesus to draw me
into the flames of His Love, to unite me
so closely to Himself that He may live
and act in me. I feel that the more the
fire of love inflames my heart, the more
I shall say: “Draw me,” the more also
will the souls who draw near to mine run
swiftly in the fragrant odours of the
Well-Beloved.</p>

<p class="author">

<p>Souls thus on fire cannot rest inactive.
They may sit at the feet of
Jesus, like Saint Mary Magdalene, listening
to His sweet and ardent words; but,
while seeming to give nothing, they
do give far more than Martha who
troubles herself with <i>many things</i>.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
not however of Martha’s labours that
Jesus disapproves, but only her too great
anxiety; to this very same work His
Blessed Mother humbly submitted herself,
when she had to prepare the repasts
for the Holy Family.</p>

<p>All the Saints have understood this,
and more especially perhaps those who
have enlightened the world with the
luminous teaching of the Gospel. Was
it not from prayer that Saint Paul, Saint
Augustine, Saint Thomas of Aquin,
Saint John of the Cross, Saint Teresa and
so many other friends of God drew that
wondrous science which enraptures the
greatest intellects?</p>

<p>Archimedes said: “Give me a lever
and a fulcrum, and I will raise the
world.” What he was unable to obtain
because his request had but a material
end and was not addressed to God, the
Saints have obtained in full measure.
For fulcrum, the Almighty has given
them Himself, Himself alone! for lever,
prayer, which enkindles the fire of love;
and thus it is that they have uplifted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
the world, thus it is that saints still
militant, uplift it, and will uplift it till
the end of time.</p>

<p>The Creator of the universe awaits
the prayer of one poor little soul to save
a multitude of others, redeemed like her
at the price of His Blood.</p>

<p>Our vocation is not to go and reap in
the Father’s fields; Jesus does not say
to us: “Cast down your eyes and reap
the harvest”; our mission is still more
sublime. Here are the words of the
Divine Master: “<i>Lift up your eyes and
see</i> ...” see that in Heaven there are
empty places; yours it is to fill them ... you
are as Moses praying on the mountain;
ask of Me labourers and I will
send them, I await but a prayer, a sigh
from out your heart!</p>

<p>Is not the apostolate of prayer higher
as one might say, than that of preaching?
It is for us to form labourers who by
preaching the Gospel, will save thousands
of souls of whom we thus become the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
mothers; what then have we to envy
the Priests of the Lord?</p>

<p class="author">

<p>How beautiful is our vocation! It
is for us, it is for Carmel to preserve
“<i>the salt of the earth</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> We offer our
prayers and sacrifices for the apostles
of the Lord; we ought ourselves to be
their apostles while by word and example
they preach the Gospel to our brethren.</p>

<p>A novice was grieving about her
numerous distractions during prayer:
“I too, have many,” replied Sœur
Thérèse de l’Enfant Jésus, “but I accept
all for love of the good God, even the
most extravagant thoughts that come
into my head.”</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">COUNSELS AND REMINISCENCES</span><br>
</p>


<p>Her prayer was continual though she
was habitually plunged in aridity. One
day a novice entering her cell, paused,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
struck by the celestial expression of her
countenance. She was sewing with alacrity
yet seemed lost in profound contemplation.</p>

<p>“Of what are you thinking?” asked
the young Sister. “I am meditating
on the <i>Pater</i>,” she replied. “It is so
sweet to call the good God our Father.”
And tears shone in her eyes.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">HIST. D’UNE AME, CH. XII</span><br>
</p>


<p>I do not well see what more I shall
have in Heaven than now, she once said.
I shall see the good God, it is true; but
as to being with Him, I am wholly with
Him already upon earth.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">HIST. D’UNE AME, CH. XII</span><br>
</p>


<p>A living flame of Divine Love consumed
her.</p>

<p>“A few days after my oblation to
<i>God’s Merciful Love</i>,” she relates, “I had
commenced in the Choir the Way of the
Cross, when I felt myself suddenly
wounded by a dart of fire so ardent that
I thought I must die. I know not how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
to describe this transport; there is no
comparison which would make one understand
the intensity of that flame. An
invisible power seemed to plunge me
wholly into fire ... but oh! what fire!
what sweetness!”</p>

<p>The Mother Prioress asked her whether
this transport was the first in her life,
she answered simply:</p>

<p>“Mother, I have several times had
transports of love; once especially during
my novitiate when I remained one entire
week far indeed from this world; for me,
there was as it were, a veil thrown over
all things of the earth. But I was not
consumed by a real flame, I was able to
sustain those delights without expecting
that their intensity would cause my
earthly fetters to snap asunder, whilst
on the day of which I speak, one minute,
one second more and my soul must have
left its prison.... Alas!—and I found
myself again on earth, and aridity
immediately returned to my heart!”</p>

<h2>HOLY COMMUNION</h2>


<p>How sweet it was, the first kiss of
Jesus to my soul! Yes, it was a kiss of
Love. I felt I was loved, and I too said:
“I love Thee, I give myself to Thee for
ever!” Jesus asked nothing of me,
demanded no sacrifice. Already for a
long time past, He and the little Thérèse
had watched and understood one another....
That day our meeting was no
longer a simple look but a <i>fusion</i>. No
longer were we two: Thérèse had disappeared
as the drop of water which
loses itself in the depths of the ocean,
Jesus alone remained; the Master, the
King! Had not Thérèse begged Him to
take away from her, her liberty? That
liberty made her afraid; so weak, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
fragile did she feel herself that she
longed to be united for ever to Divine
Strength.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">HIST. D’UNE AME, CH. IV</span><br>
</p>


<p>I had taken as my rule of conduct,
to receive most faithfully Holy Communion
as often as my confessor permitted,
without ever asking that it might
be more frequent. I would act differently
now; for I am quite sure that a
soul ought to make known to her director
the attraction that she feels to receive
her God. It is not to remain in a golden
ciborium that He comes down each day
from Heaven, but to find another Heaven,
the Heaven of our soul in which He
takes His delight.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">HIST. D’UNE AME, CH. V</span><br>
</p>


<p>What shall I say of my thanksgivings
after Holy Communion? There are
no moments in which I feel less consolation.
And is not this very natural, seeing
that my desire is to receive our Lord’s
visit, not for my own satisfaction, but
solely for His pleasure?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>I imagine my soul to be as a plot of
waste ground and beg the Blessed Virgin
to remove from it all the rubbish—meaning
its imperfections; then I beseech
her to erect thereon, a vast canopy
worthy of Heaven and to decorate it with
her own treasures, and I invite all the
Angels and Saints to come and sing canticles
of love. It seems to me then that
Jesus is pleased to see Himself so magnificently
received; and I, I share His joy.
All this does not hinder distractions and
sleep from molesting me; therefore it
not rarely happens that I resolve to
continue my thanksgiving all the day long,
since I have made it so badly in the
Choir.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">HIST. D’UNE AME, CH. VIII</span><br>
</p>


<p>At the time of Holy Communion I
sometimes picture my soul under the
figure of a little child of three or four
years, who at play has got its hair tossed
and its clothes soiled.—These misfortunes
have befallen me in battling with
souls.—But very soon the Blessed Virgin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
hastens to my aid: quickly she takes
off my little dirty pinafore, smooths my
hair and adorns it with a pretty ribbon
or simply with a little flower ... and this
suffices to render me pleasing and enables
me to sit at the Banquet of Angels without
blushing.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">COUNSELS AND REMINISCENCES</span><br>
</p>


<p>The demon, traitor that he is, knows
well, that he cannot make a soul who
wills to belong wholly to the good God,
commit sin; therefore he endeavours
only to persuade her that she sins. That
is a great deal gained, but it is not yet
enough to satisfy his rage ... he aims
at something further, he wants to deprive
Jesus of a loved tabernacle. Not being
able himself to enter into this sanctuary
he wishes that it may at least remain
empty and without its Lord. Alas!
what will become of this poor heart?...
When the devil has succeeded in driving
away a soul from Holy Communion he
has gained his ends, and Jesus weeps....</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">I LETTER TO HER COUSIN MARIE GUÉRIN</span><br>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>


<p>A novice relates that she wanted to
deprive herself of Holy Communion
because of some lack of fidelity. She
wrote her determination to Sister Thérèse
of the Child Jesus who thus replied:</p>

<p>“Little flower cherished by Jesus, it is
amply sufficient that by the humiliation
of your soul your roots <i>eat of the earth</i>....
You must open a little, or rather raise
on high your corolla so that the Bread of
Angels may come as a divine dew to
strengthen you, and to give you all that
is wanting to you.</p>

<p>“Good-night, poor little floweret; ask
of Jesus that all the prayers offered for
my recovery may serve to augment the
fire which must consume me.”</p>

<h2>SUFFERING<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></h2>


<p>The cross has accompanied me from
the cradle; but then, Jesus has made
me love it passionately.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">IX LETTER TO HER MISSIONARY “BROTHERS”</span><br>
</p>


<p>One day my sister Marie, speaking of
suffering, said that instead of making me
walk by that way, the good God would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
no doubt carry me always like a little
child. These words recurred to me after
Holy Communion on the following day,
and my heart was fired with an ardent
desire of suffering. I felt too an inward
assurance, that crosses in great number
were in reserve for me. Then my soul
was inundated with consolations such
as I have never had again in all my life.
Suffering became my attraction, in it I
found charms that entranced me.</p>

<p>Another great desire that I felt, was
to love but God alone and to find no joy
save only in Him. Often during my
thanksgiving after Holy Communion I
used to repeat this passage from the
<i>Imitation:</i> “<i>O Jesus, who art ineffable
sweetness, turn for me into bitterness all
the consolations of earth.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> These words
came from my lips without effort; I
uttered them like a child who repeats
without too well understanding, words
prompted by a friend.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">HIST. D’UNE AME, CH. IV</span><br>
</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>

<p>Suffering has held out its arms to
me from my very entrance into Carmel
and lovingly have I embraced it. My
intention in coming here, I declared in
the solemn examination which preceded
my profession: <i>I am come in order to
save souls, and especially to pray for
Priests</i>. When we want to attain an
end we must employ the means, and
Jesus having made me understand that
He would give me souls by means of the
cross, the more crosses I met with the
more my attraction to suffering increased.
During five years this way was mine; but
I alone knew it. Here was just the
hidden flower that I wanted to offer
to Jesus, this flower which exhaled its
fragrance for Heaven alone.</p>

<p>In my soul’s intercourse with Jesus—nothing ...
dryness! sleep! Since my Beloved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
wills to sleep I shall not hinder
Him; I am too happy in seeing that He
does not treat me like a stranger, that
He is not constrained with me. He
pierces His little ball through and through
with pin-pricks sore indeed.... When it
is this tender Friend who Himself pierces
His ball, the pain is naught but sweetness—so
gentle is His Hand. How
different when creatures pierce it!</p>

<p>Yet I am happy, yes, truly happy to
suffer. If Jesus does not Himself directly
pierce His little ball, it is certainly He
who guides the hand that wounds!</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">II LETTER TO MÈRE AGNÈS DE JÉSUS</span><br>

<p>Yes, I desire them, those heart-thrusts,
those pin-pricks that give so
much pain.... Sacrifice I prefer to all
ecstacies: therein lies happiness for me,
I find it nowhere else. <i>The little reed</i>
has no fear of breaking, for it is planted
on the shore of the waters of Love; and
so, when it bends, that beneficent wave
invigorates it, and makes it long for
another storm to come and bow down its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
head anew. My weakness it is, that
makes my whole strength. Whatever
happens I cannot get broken; I see only
the gentle hand of Jesus.</p>

great.</p>

delight in the thought that God has

will it be, when in Heaven’s eternal

<p>Let us not expect to find Love without
Suffering. Our nature is there, and
it is not there for nothing; but what
treasures it enables us to acquire! It
is our means of gain; so precious is it
that Jesus came down upon earth expressly
to possess it.... We want to
suffer generously, grandly; we wish
never to fall; what illusion! And what
does it matter to me if I fall every minute?
I find great profit in it, for thereby I see
my weakness. My God, You know what
I am capable of unless You carry me in
Your arms; and if You leave me alone,
well; it is that it pleases you to see me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>

<p>Life is often irksome and bitter; it
is hard to begin a laborious day, above
all when Jesus hides Himself from us.
What is this tender Friend doing?
Does He not then see our anguish,
the load that oppresses us; where is
He? Why does He not come to console
us?</p>

<p>Ah, fear not.... He is there, quite
near! He is watching us; He, it is, who
begs for these our labours and our
tears.... He has need of them for souls,
for our soul; He wants to give us so
glorious a recompense. Ah! truly, it
costs Him to make us drink of this
bitter cup, but He knows that it is the
one way by which to prepare us to know
Him as He knows Himself and to become
ourselves God-like. What a destiny!
How great is the soul. Let us rise above
all that passes away, let us hold aloof
from the earth, up on high the air is so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>

intense the suffering and the less apparent

<p>Life is full of sacrifices, it is true;
but why look for happiness in it? Is it
not simply “a night to be passed in a
bad Inn” as says our Holy Mother Saint
Teresa?</p>

<p>My heart has an ardent thirst for
happiness, but well do I see that no
creature is capable of allaying this thirst.
On the contrary, the more I might
drink of the waters of that enchanted
spring the more burning would be my
thirst.</p>

<p>I know a fountain where <i>they that
drink shall yet thirst</i>,<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> but with a thirst
most sweet, a thirst one can always
satisfy; this fountain is the suffering
that is known to Jesus alone!...</p>

<p>Our Lord never asks of us any
sacrifice above our strength. Sometimes,
in truth, the Divine Master makes us
taste the full bitterness of the chalice
which He presents to our soul. When
He asks the sacrifice of everything most
dear to us in this world, it is impossible
unless by a very special grace, not to cry
out as He did in the Garden of the
Agony: “<i>My Father, let this chalice pass
from Me....</i>” But let us also hasten
to add: “<i>Nevertheless not as I will but as
Thou wilt.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> It is very consoling to
think that Jesus—Divine Strength itself—has
experienced all our weakness,
that He trembled at the sight of the
bitter chalice, the chalice He had longed
for so ardently.</p>

<p>A novice was complaining of being
more tired than her Sisters, for besides
the common work, she had done another
task, of which they knew nothing.
Thérèse answered: “I want to see you
always like a valiant soldier who does
not complain of his pains; who thinks
very seriously of the wounds of his
brothers and regards his own as mere
scratches. Why do you feel this fatigue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
to such a degree? It is because no one
knows about it....</p>

<p>During the first months of her
illness it was on her hard palliasse that
Sister Thérèse passed the time of rest,
and her nights were very bad: when
asked whether she did not need some
assistance during those hours of pain,
she replied: “Oh, no on the contrary, I
think myself very fortunate to be in a
cell distant enough for my Sisters not to
hear me. I rejoice to suffer alone; but

<p>The Sister infirmarian remarking,
“It is said that you have never suffered
very much.” Thérèse smiled and pointing
to a glass containing a draught of
medicine, bright red in colour, replied,
“See this little glass, one would imagine
it full of some choice liqueur, but in
reality I take nothing that is more bitter.
Well! it is an image of my life; to the
eyes of others it has ever appeared
clothed in the most radiant hues; to
them it seemed as though I drank a
delicious liqueur, while in truth it was
bitterness. I say bitterness, and yet
my life has not been bitter, for I have
known how to make of all bitterness my
sweetness and my joy.”</p>

<p>“You are in great pain at this moment,
are you not?” “Yes ... but I have so

<p>A sister, who doubted her patience,
noticed, when visiting her one day, an

<p><a id="Footnote_88" href="#FNanchor_88" class="label">[88]</a> No reader should be discouraged by this
chapter on Suffering. What Sœur Thérèse says
is very consoling for those who are nailed to
the Cross; and others must remember that
God had given to His humble Servant a <i>sensible</i>
attraction for suffering, which is a rare grace
and reserved to very few souls, though many
imagine they possess it, and mistake their road
choosing to follow this supposed attraction.
Without the sensible desire and even though
experiencing an invincible repugnance to suffer,
souls can be sanctified. What pleases God is
that the suffering be borne with love.</p>

<h2>THE DIRECTION OF
SOULS</h2>


<p>Our Lord allowed me the consolation
of closely studying the souls of children.</p>

<p>Considering these innocent souls I
used to compare them to soft wax, upon
which any impression may be stamped,
the bad, alas! like the good; and I understood
those words of Jesus: “<i>But he
that shall scandalize one of these little ones ...
it were better for him that a millstone
were hanged about his neck and that he
were drowned in the depth of the sea.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
Oh! how many souls might attain to a
high degree of holiness if wisely guided
from the very first.</p>

<p>I well know that to accomplish His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
work of sanctification, God has need of
no one, but just as He enables a skilful
gardener to rear plants that are delicate
and rare, granting him for this end all
the knowledge necessary, while reserving
to Himself the care of giving the increase,
so, too, does He will to be aided in His
divine culture of souls.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">HIST. D’UNE AME, CH. V</span><br>
</p>


<p>As soon as I penetrated into the
sanctuary of souls I judged at the first
glance that the task exceeded my powers,
and very quickly placing myself in the
arms of the good God I imitated the
little child, who, seized with sudden
fear, tries to hide its golden head on its
father’s shoulder, and I said: “Lord,
Thou knowest it, I am myself too little
to be capable of nurturing these Thy
children; if Thou dost will to give to
them, through me, what is suited to
each one, fill Thou my little hand, and
without leaving Thine arms, without
even turning my head aside, I will
distribute Thy treasures to the souls who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
come to me to seek sustenance. When
they find it to their liking I shall know
that it is not to me they owe it but to
Thee; on the other hand if they complain,
and find bitter what I offer them,
my peace shall remain undisturbed,
I will try to convince them that this
nutriment comes from Thee, and I will
carefully refrain from seeking any other
for them.”</p>

<p>When I thus understood that it was
impossible for me to do anything by myself,
the task appeared to me simplified.
Interiorly, I occupied myself solely in
trying to become more and more united
to God—knowing that the rest would
be added unto me.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">HIST. D’UNE AME, CH. X</span><br>
</p>


<p>From afar it seems easy to do good
to souls, to make them love God more,
to mould them after our own views and
opinions. But coming closer one feels,
on the contrary, that to do good without
the divine assistance, is as impossible a
thing as to bring the sun back after it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
has set. One feels that it is absolutely
necessary to forget our own inclinations,
our personal notions, and to guide souls,
not by our own way—the way we
ourselves go—but by the particular
way that Jesus wishes to lead them.</p>

<p class="author">

<p>When very young, and staying with
my aunt, a book was given to me to read.
In one of the stories I saw that the
mistress of a school was much praised
because she knew how to get on cleverly
in the world without offending anyone.
This phrase I remarked especially: “She
would say to the one, ‘You are not
wrong,’ and to the other, ‘You are right;’”
and while I read I was thinking: “Oh!...
I would not have acted thus; we must
always tell the truth.” And so I do,
always. Far more difficult it certainly
is, for when told of some little vexatious
occurrence, it would be easy to lay blame
on the absent, and she who complains
would at once be pacified. Yes, but ...
I do quite the reverse. If I am not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
liked, what matter! Let no one come
to me who does not want to hear the
truth.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">COUNSELS AND REMINISCENCES</span><br>
</p>


<p>That a reprimand may be fruitful it
must cost in the giving; and it must be
given without a shade of passion in the
heart.</p>

<p>One must not let kindness degenerate
into weakness. When we have blamed
justly we ought to leave it so, and not
yield to feelings of distress at having
given pain. To run after the aggrieved
one in order to console her, is to do more
harm than good. To leave her to herself
is to force her to expect nothing from
creatures, to have recourse to the good
God, to see her failings and to humble
herself. Otherwise she would grow accustomed
to being consoled after a deserved
rebuke and would behave as does a
spoilt child, who stamps and cries, well
knowing that this will make its mother
return to wipe away the tears.</p>

<p><i>Let the sword of the Spirit, which is the

hearts.</i><a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> If we have to do with a difficult
soul, let us not be discouraged, nor ever
abandon her. Let us have always “<i>the
sword of the Spirit</i>” to reprehend her for
her faults, and not allow things to pass
for the sake of leaving ourselves in
repose; let us fight unceasingly, even
without hope of gaining the victory.
What matter about success! Let us
fight on, whatever be the weariness of
the struggle. Let us not say: “I can
make nothing of this soul, she does not
understand; I must give it up.” Oh!
what cowardice that would be. We must
do our duty unto the end.</p>

astonished at the things that I teach
you. I simply feel in saying them to

<span class="allsmcap">HIST. D’UNE AME, CH. XII</span><br>

<p>“Give us some advice as to how we
ought to act concerning our spiritual
direction,” they said to her.</p>

<p>“With great simplicity and without
depending too much on assistance, which
may fail you at any moment. You

will direct you. Nevertheless, most frequently,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>

<h2>THE BLESSED VIRGIN</h2>


<p>How I love the Blessed Virgin!
Had I been a Priest, oh! how I should
have spoken of her. She is represented
as unapproachable, rather ought she to
be shown as imitable. She is more
Mother than Queen. I have heard it
said that all the Saints are eclipsed by
her radiant brightness as the sun at
rising makes the stars disappear. How
strange that seems—a mother eclipsing
the glory of her children! I think quite
the contrary. I believe that she will
immensely increase the splendour of the
elect.... The Virgin Mary! how simple
does her life appear to me....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>


<p>Sometimes I find myself saying to
the Holy Virgin: “Do you know, O
cherished Mother, that I think myself
more fortunate than you? I have you
for Mother and you have not, like me,
the Blessed Virgin to love.... You
are, it is true, the Mother of Jesus, but
you have given Him to me, and He,
from the cross gave you to us as our
Mother, so we are richer than you.
Of old it was your desire that you might
be the little handmaiden of the Mother
of God; and I, poor little creature, I am,
not your servant, but <i>your child</i>: you
are the Mother of Jesus and you are <i>my
Mother</i>.”</p>

<h2>VARIOUS SUBJECTS</h2>


<p>Léonie, no doubt finding that she
was growing too old to play with dolls,
came one day to Céline and me, with a
basket full of dolls’ clothes, odds and
ends of pretty materials, trimmings, etc.,
on which she had laid her doll, saying
to us: “There, little sisters—choose!”
Céline looked, and took a knot of edging.
After reflecting a moment I, in turn,
put out my hand saying: “I choose all!”
and I carried off basket and doll without
further ceremony.</p>

<p>This trait of my childhood is, as it
were, a summary of my entire life.
Later on when the meaning of perfection
began to unfold itself to me, I understood
that to become a saint it is necessary to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
suffer much, ever to seek after that
which is most perfect, and to forget
self. I understood that in sanctity the
degrees are many, that each soul is free
to respond to the advances of our Lord,
to do little or much for His sake, in a
word, to <i>choose</i> between the sacrifices
that He asks. Then, as in the days of
my childhood, I exclaimed: “My God,
I choose all! I do not wish to be a saint
by halves; the thought of suffering for
Thee does not frighten me, one thing
only do I fear—my own will; take Thou
my will, for <i>I choose all</i> that Thou willest.”</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="allsmcap">HIST. D’UNE AME, CH. I</span><br>

<p>My Father took me for a pleasant
tour during which I began to know a little
of the world. Around me all was gaiety
and delight; I was made welcome,
petted, admired, in short, for fifteen
days the pathway of my life was strewn
with naught but flowers. Holy Wisdom
well says that <i>the bewitching of trifles
overturneth the innocent mind</i>.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> At the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
age of ten the heart easily allows itself
to be dazzled, and I own that this sort
of life had some charms for me. Alas!
how well the world contrives to reconcile
the delights of earth with the service
of God. How seldom does it think of
death.</p>

<p>And death, nevertheless, has come to
a great many of the people whom I
then knew, young, rich and prosperous.
I like to go back in thought to their
beautiful dwellings, to ask myself where
are they, and what benefit do they now
draw from the castles and parks where

<p>What compassion I have for souls
who are going astray. It is so easy to
lose one’s way in the flowery paths of
the world. Undoubtedly for a soul
who has risen a little above the things of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
earth, the sweetness offered is intermingled
with bitterness, and the immense
void of its desires cannot be filled by the
praises of a moment.</p>

<p>We have but life’s brief day to save
souls and thus to give to Jesus proof of
our love. The morrow of this day will
be Eternity and then He will render to
you a hundredfold for the joys which
you have sacrificed for Him. He knows
the extent of your sacrifice, He knows
that the grief of those dear to you increases
your own still more; but to save
our souls He has Himself suffered this
martyrdom. He too, left His Mother,
He saw the Immaculate Virgin stand at
the foot of the Cross, her heart transpierced
by the sword of sorrow.</p>

<p>Ah! if the Divine Master would but
grant to those whom you are going to
leave for His sake, a foresight of the
glory He reserves for you, the multitude
of souls who in heaven will form your
train, they would be already recompensed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
for their great sacrifice in parting with
you.</p>

<p>The good God has promised a
hundredfold to all who have left father
or mother or sister for love of Him.
These words are, I know, usually applied
to those who have entered the religious
state, but in my heart I feel that they
were also spoken for the generous parents
who make to God the sacrifice of children
whom they cherish more than self.</p>

<p>How can a heart given up to human

which burns without consuming.</p>

<p>When in the morning we feel no
courage, no energy for the practice of
virtue, this is a grace, this is the moment
to “<i>lay the axe to the root of the tree</i>”<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
depending solely on Jesus. If we fall
all is retrieved by an act of love, and
Jesus smiles. He helps us without appearing
to do so, and the tears which
the wicked cause Him to shed are
dried by our poor feeble love.</p>

<p>We must practice the little virtues.
This is difficult sometimes, but the good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
God never refuses the first grace, which
gives courage to conquer self: if the soul
corresponds to it she will find that she
immediately receives light. I have ever
been struck with those words of praise
to Judith: “<i>Thou hast done manfully, and
thy heart has been strengthened.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> We

<p>My God, how varied are the ways by
which Thou dost lead souls. In reading
the Lives of the Saints we find a great
number of whom nothing has remained
to us after their death: not the smallest
souvenir, not a written line. Others
there are, on the contrary, like our Holy
Mother Saint Teresa, who have enriched
the Church with their sublime doctrine,
not fearing <i>to reveal the secrets of the King</i>,<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
in the hope that souls might know Him
better and love Him more. Which of
these two ways pleases our Lord best?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
It seems to me that they are equally
pleasing to Him.</p>

<p>All the well-beloved of God have
followed the inspiration of the Holy
Spirit by whom the Prophet wrote:
“<i>Say to the just that all is well.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Yes,
all is well when we seek only the Divine
Will.</p>

<p>How narrow are the thoughts of
creatures! When they see that a soul
has lights which surpass their own, they
conclude that the Divine Master loves
them less. Since when, then, has He
lost the right to make use of one of His
creatures, in order to dispense to His
children the sustenance needful for them?</p>

<p class="author">

<p>When we are grieved at our powerlessness

<p>Though I do not undervalue beautiful
thoughts that seem to unite us to
God, I have long understood that we
must carefully guard against leaning
too much upon them. The most sublime
inspirations are nothing without
deeds.</p>

<p>Other souls, it is true, may draw therefrom
much profit if they testify humble
gratitude to God for being permitted to
share the feast of one of His privileged
children. But if the privileged one were
to grow vain of her spiritual riches, if
her prayer resembled that of the Pharisee,
she herself would become like to a person
starving to death before a well-served
table while all her guests take from it
abundant nourishment, and cast perhaps
a look of envy on the possessor of so
much wealth.</p>

<p>The Spouse in the Canticles, not

Beloved, arose, she says and went about

she could not find Him save beyond the

that we should find His adorable Presence

envelopes Himself with darkness.... It
was not thus He acted in regard to the
multitudes, for we read in the Gospels

“I have thought so myself, and in future
I shall never cry but when alone with the

my trials, He will always understand
and console me.”</p>

she replied with vivacity, “take care
you do no such thing. Still less, by far,
before Him than before creatures ought
you to exhibit signs of sadness. He has
but our monasteries, this dear Master,
to rejoice His Heart; He comes amongst
us to find a little repose, to forget the
continual lamentations of His friends in
the world who for the most part, instead
of recognizing the value of the Cross,
meet it with repining and with tears;
and would you behave like the generality

sorrowful, not being able to find in you
the repose He sought. Jesus loves the

her so ill often exclaimed: “Oh, how

<p>“Life is not sad, but on the contrary
most joyful. If you said ‘How sad is
our exile,’ I should understand you.
It is erroneous to give the name, ‘<i>life</i>,’
to that which must end. Only to the

life is not sad but joyful—joyous
